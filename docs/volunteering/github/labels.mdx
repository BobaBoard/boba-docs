# Issue Labels

BobaBoard uses labels to classify issues and feature requests according to a variety of criteria.

For ease of reference, labels are further divided in the following macro-categories:

- [**ðŸŽ¨ Thematic labels**](#thematic-labels) indicate the overall theme of the issue or feature request.
- [**ðŸ›  Skills labels**](#skills-labels) indicate the technical skills necessary to tackle the issue or feature request.
- [**ðŸ“¦ Repository labels**](#repository-labels) indicate the repositories the issue or feature request touches upon.
- [**ðŸ”¥ Priority labels**](#priority-labels) indicate the priority of the issue or feature request.

You can click on any of these labels to see the associated issues.
