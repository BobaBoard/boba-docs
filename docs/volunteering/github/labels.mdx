# Issue Labels

BobaBoard uses labels to classify issues and feature requests according to a variety of criteria.

For ease of reference, labels are further divided in the following macro-categories:

- **🎨 Thematic labels** indicate the overall theme of the issue or feature request.
- **🛠 Skills labels**: indicate the technical skills necessary to tackle the issue or feature request.
- **🔥 Priority labels**: indicate the priority of the issue or feature request.

You can click on any of these labels to see the associated issues.

## Thematic labels

<FilteredLabelsList prefix="🎨" />

## Priority labels

<FilteredLabelsList prefix="🔥" />
