# Intro

This sections will contain a list of open positions, their requirements and expectations.

...but we aren't there yet.

In the meantime, you can sign up for volunteering through our [tech](https://forms.gle/jG2gbfpxVhUE7vyn9) and [non-tech](https://forms.gle/Z44UreTxnbvFnoqc9) forms.

### Q: I signed up for volunteering but never received a reply!

First of all, sorry about that! As Ms. Boba is the only person manning this ship, applications have sometimes slipped through the cracks.

We're currently in the process of creating a more robust volunteers management process. In the meantime, if you're bursting at the seams to get started, you can follow up with her via [email](mailto:ms.boba@bobaboard.com).

This is a running list of potential positions. Since we haven't defined actual expectations, they're not theoretically open for applications.
