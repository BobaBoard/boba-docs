# Accessability Bug Finder Volunteer Position
This guide goes over the volunteer job of discovering, cataloguing, and fixing accessability bugs.

:::note
Please make sure you've read the [BobaCoard Code of Coduct for Volunteering](../before-you-start.md) before volunteering for this position.

## Finding Bugs

In this case, finding accessability bugs are different from regular bug discovery. In that case, usually something is broken within the site's code and/or new updates that are
causing issues in usage. But when it comes to accessability bugs, this is more generalized: Where are the "bugs" in Boba's current set up that can be "fixed"/changed/improved
for accessability.

**Example:**
When using a screen reader on BobaBoard, Volunteer A notices blockquotes are not being read aloud. Volunteer A is visually impared and relies on their screen reader to
navigate websites, so this keeps them from enjoying BobaBoard to the fullest extent. 

## Logging Bugs

(Here's where to go to log bugs idk where that is)

**Example**
Volunteer A is not a coder and does not know how to fix this problem, so they go to the Boba Bug Tracker and files the bug. 

## Further Volunteer Help

Whenever volunteers log a bug in the Boba Bug Tracker, it alerts Ms. Boba to them. As she is often the only person working on live code, she cannot always be there to make
fixes as quickly as they are needed. Instead, she may send the volunteer a link to either a BobaDocs page where a similar issue was logged, and/or other helpful information,
and then ask the volunteer if they would be willing to help with the fix to make it go faster. If the volunteer accepts, they can follow the directions on how to copy GH code 
[here](https://bobadocs.netlify.app/docs/volunteering/writing/editing-bobadocs/) and begin working.

**Example 1**
Ms. Boba sees the bug has been filed, but is unable to work on the problem at that exact moment. Instead, she forwards Volunteer A a page from the BobaDocs she wrote where a
similar issue happened previously. This Doc outlines the issue and how to fix it. Volunteer A, armed with coding the knowledge housed in the BobaDoc, goes into the correct 
place on GitHub and plays with the code to propose a solution to the screen reader issue.

**Example 2**
Ms. Boba sees the bug has been filed, but is unsure how it can be fixed. She consults Volunteer A and learns more about them, the programs they use for accessability, and then
does her own research into the topic. She finds a possible solution and reaches back out to  Volunteer A to see if they would be willing to help create new code to make the
interaction between screen readers and BobaBoard work better. She points Volunteer A to the site where she discovered the possible solution and then to the parts of GitHub
and BobaDocs that could help Volunteer A learn the basic code they would need to fix the problem.

## Final Review and Usage

Once the volunteer has written their proposal and submitted it, Ms. Boba reviews it to see if it is viable. If more information is needed, she may reach back out to the 
volunteer. If not, she may make changes where they are needed and deploy the code. 

**Congratulations!** You have finished your volunteer job! If you're now interested in helping with similar problems, check the Boba Bug Tracker to see if other people have 
noticed the same issue elsewhere, or continue your search for more bugs to file and work on!
