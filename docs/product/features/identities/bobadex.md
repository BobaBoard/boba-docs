# BobaDex

Each `Realm` that supports `Anonymity` must have an associated `BobaDex`, containing all the anonymous
identities that can be assigned to `Users` when they create new `Threads`.

A `BobaDex` can be further divided in `Seasons`, each containing a subset of the `Identities` in the `BobaDex`.

:::OPEN QUESTION

- Can `Boards` or `Threads` have their own BobaDex?
- Can `Users` choose which `Season` to post from when joining a `Thread`?
