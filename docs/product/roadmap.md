# Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 9/18/2021

## Where we are

- Alpha community chugging along for 1+ years!
  - Incidents have been rare, and resolved succesfully.
  - Maintainance has been very hands-free (yet here we are).
- Realms have been announced (see [website](https://www.bobaboard.com)).
- Our [support channels](https://www.bobaboard.com/support-us) are bringing in some $$$ (or, more accurately, $).
- We have a skeleton of a documentation website and (very early) volunteering processes.

## Where we're going

- **[P0]:** Volunteer processes
  - **Answering the Q:** What makes for a _great_ volunteering environment?
  - **Current WIPs:**
    - Well-defined positions and expectations.
    - This documentation.
    - Standardization of code practices (including cleaning up our REST API).
- **[P0]:** Realms
  - **Preliminary Phase (now)**:
    - Update BobaBoard's REST API (and DB schema) to support multiple communities coexisting on the same instance (Galaxy).
  - **Building Phase (soon)**:
    - Add administration features needed for admins without access to underlying DB.
      - TODO: define features needed -> figure out open UX questions -> figure out base components to build out -> figure out new REST API endpoints -> figure out frontend changes -> parallelize building/solving these as much as possible -> ??? -> profit.
    - Figure out recruitement strategy/selection process.
      - What do we want to learn?
      - Which guarantees do we offer in terms of availability/reliability/ability to help solve conflicts or issues?
        - Share detailed product roadmaps with stakeholders to help make informed choice.
      - What is our responsibility? What is the Realm's admin responsibility?
        - This phase of growth must really stress the _allies_ part of the whole deal.
  - **Explorative Phase (god, i wish i knew)**:
    - Discoverability
    - "Feeds"
    - Cross-realms identity management
