# Mockups

In this section you can find low-res mockups of the various components that form BobaBoard. These are made
with [Excalidraw](htttps://www.excalidraw.com), and can be downloaded and imported in their editor
to play around with design proposals.

## Layout

![test](./board_background.excalidraw)

For now, this is the only one we have, mostly because Ms Boba went into a rabbit hole about integrating
excalidraw into MDX files.
