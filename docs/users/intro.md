# BobaBoard Basics

_"BobaBoard will move you and fill you with a feeling of deep peace. I hope your time here will be pleasant and your memories will last forever."_

## What is BobaBoard?
**The Simple Answer:** A social media site made for fandom by people in fandom.

**The Detailed Answer:** BobaBoard is the brain child of Ms. Boba who woke up to tumblr's porn ban and decided enough was enough. She set out to create an open source platform that could meet the evolving demands of fandom, a place that could support the needs of varying communities by being adaptable, stable, and fun to use, where fandom made the rules.

The result is a social media site that's part-forum, part-Discord, part-LJ clone, and yet none of those at all.

## How BobaBoard is Different...
We hear you: you already have 37 social accounts and maybe use 3 of them, if you squint, why would you want another? Why give another startup platform a chance? What's _different_ about this place?

### Realms
:::info

This section of the guide is still in development! We're still in the process of figuring out how Realms will work. The general idea is explained below, but your input will help shape things!

:::

BobaBoard is made up of distinct areas called **Realms**. Like LJ and its clones (and to some extent, Discord), each Realm is its own domain within the BobaBoard "network". Each Realm may have different goals, cultures, and rules.

As BobaBoard expands to be open to the public, Moderators will be able to establish their own Realms. Users will have to join each Realm they want posting and reading access to and explicitly agree to their rules.

There are currently two Realms making up BobaBoard:
- V0: The Alpha
  > The OG BobaBoard. A closed Alpha for Ms. Boba's friends, Boba volunteers, and early adopters.

- Fandom Coders
  > The first official "Realm". It's a community of fandom people who also code or want to learn to code, particularly if they use coding in their fandom activities!

For more information on each Realm, visit their sections in the guide.

### Boards, Not Blogs
Each **Realm** is made up of multiple Boards. Boards are similar to the boards in a forum or modern Discord channels; they define the broad topics of conversations and give users a heads-up as to what they can expect to find.

To interact in the Realm, you simply post to whatever you find most appropriate. Don't worry about getting it wrong: there is no wrong. If something might fit in more than one place, simply choose the one that's most appropriate according to your own nebulous criteria.

_"The boards are more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules."_

Unlike other fandom spaces, there's no personal "blog" or "page" on BobaBoard. There's no user address that you can give someone so that they can see all your posts. You won't have followers, friends, or mutuals.

### Random Anonymous Identities
Identities are assigned at random each time a user starts a post, comments, or contributes. Initially, you might be confused by seeing the same anonymous identities all around the space. Just know that, outside a single thread, *the users behind these identities are not the same*. There's not a single "Revolver Ocelot (Revolver Ocelot)": every new thread each identity is shuffled and reassigned to someone else. 

Who knows, maybe you'll be the next "Revolver Ocelot (Revolver Ocelot)"!

:::caution

Having a  random anon identity does not give you free reign to be an asshole. Ms. Boba (and eventually moderators) are able to tell who has posted what and to take action if necessary. For more info, please see When and How We Deanon.

:::

:::info Future Plans

There are future plans to allow users to deanon in two ways:

- **By Having Static Identities**

    For example, some Volunteers on the V0 Realm have the options to identify themselves as specific Anonymous Volunteer Roles. This will be useful in a variety of situations from Moderation to Roleplaying.

- **By Revealing Their Actual Username**

    There may be instances where Boba Users want to know who the other person is (for example, for commissions, to connect outside of Boba, or because they're sharing a link that deanons them anyway - like a link to a fic or artwork)

# Using This Guide
BobaBoard's two Realms currently have more in common than not. The information outside of a section dedicated to a Realm pertains to BobaBoard as a whole: shared features, etiquette, and information. For things specific to each Realm (such as Rules), you can find more detailed information in their individual sections.

<!-- DOMMENTED OUT: Will be moved, but wanted to save text.
## Etiquette

What to do (and not to do) in the community.

### DO

- Be Kind.
- Be Weird.
- Be Supportive.
- Deescalate Conflict.

### DON'T DO

- Be an Asshole.
- Yuck Someone Else's Yum, as they say.
  - If you have serious concerns, do bring them up, either privately or on the appropriate Board. Please remember the "do" rules, and be mindful that the present fandom climate might make some people twitchier about certain subjects.
- Continue pressing an issue after someone has asked you to stop. In threads, **OP has final saying on what is allowed on their thread**. Making a different thread to discuss something OP would rather not touch upon is allowed, but try to avoid "subtle" jabs at the previous OP (trust us, they're never subtle). -->
