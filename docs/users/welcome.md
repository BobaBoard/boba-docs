## Etiquette

What to do (and not to do) in the community.

### DO

- Be Kind.
- Be Weird.
- Be Supportive.
- Deescalate Conflict.

### DON'T DO

- Be an Asshole.
- Yuck Someone Else's Yum, as they say.
  - If you have serious concerns, do bring them up, either privately or on the appropriate Board. Please remember the "do" rules, and be mindful that the present fandom climate might make some people twitchier about certain subjects.
- Continue pressing an issue after someone has asked you to stop. In threads, **OP has final saying on what is allowed on their thread**. Making a different thread to discuss something OP would rather not touch upon is allowed, but try to avoid "subtle" jabs at the previous OP (trust us, they're never subtle).
