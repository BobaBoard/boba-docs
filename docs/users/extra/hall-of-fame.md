## Unexpected Challenges

Webmistress posted [a Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/BobaBoard/status/1387224206786498560?s=20) requesting help with the debug of thread rendering performance. Among the people heeding her call was the author of [runyourown.social](http://runyourown.social/), a big inspiration for BobaBoard itself. Only problem: the !kinkmeme thread causing the issue featured "extremely hardcore" pornography.

> **Webmistress:** I do want to do this, but literally the second contribution to this thread starts with
