# Boards and Feeds

## Boards
As mentioned in [BobaBoard Basics: Boards](/docs/users/intro#boards), Realms are made up of Boards that define the broad topics of conversation within the Realm. The sidebar of each Board contains the Board cover image, name, description, categories, and additional relevant information (if any). On desktop, the sidebar is to the left of the screen. On mobile, you can find the Board's sidebar by clicking the navigation symbol in the top right of your screen.

Boards update chronologically, moving the most recent activity to the top for easy identification.

There are two ways to access boards:
- from the landing page, click on the board cover
- click the Board link in the sidebar menu

To access the sidebar menu, click the hamburger (three horizonal line) menu on the left side of the screen.

### The Board Menu
Once you've clicked into a Board, you can find a menu with options for the board, by clicking the triangle in the top right corner of the cover image. This allows you to control the settings for the individual board. Within that menu you can:

- **Mute/Unmute** - toggle notifications for the Board.
    - Muted boards will not show up on the **Recent Unreads** section of the menu.
    - Muting a board does not clear notifications. When you unmute, the notifications will still be present.
    - Muted boards also do not show up in your [Personal Feed](#personal-feed).
- **Pin/Unpin** - toggle whether the Boards appears in your pinned bar (to the far left of the side bar). You can pin boards so that you make sure you don't miss recent activity between visits or to make them easier to access.
- **Dismiss Notifications** - Clear notifications of unread items without having to visit them all. 

### Notifications
Notifications alert you to updated content in a board, whether that's a new thread or a comment/contribution to a thread.

## Feeds
Feeds allow you to track and follow conversations that you've started or joined without having to go to a specific board. They're similar to a timeline view which you may be familiar with on other websites. Feeds update chronologically, so that the post with the newest activity is moved to the top.

### Personal Feed
The Personal Feed shows you all threads you've posted, joined, or commented on in the Realm you're in. To access your personal feed, click the inbox tray icon in the pinned bar. To filter your feed, you can click the buttons on the left sidebar to see specific threads. An explanation for the filter combinations is below.

- **updated** **own** - all threads you've started in the Realm that have been updated with a new comment or contribution.
- **updated** **everyone** - all threads you've started or joined with a comment or contribution in the Realm that have been updated with a new comment or contribution.
- **all** **own** - every thread you've ever started in the Realm
- **all** **everyone** - every thread you've started or joined with a comment or contribution in the Realm
