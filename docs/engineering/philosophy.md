# Philosophy (draft)

This page documents the principles leading our engineering choices. It's an extreme WIP.

## Keep costs low

- As little required "paid software" as possible
  - This is also helpful for people running their own separate instances.
- the higher the costs, the more theres the risk of a single point of failure when it comes to funding, the more we risk having to rely on big donors
- a paid solution can be used in the short term if there's a clear path out of it/taken is care to ensure that we do indeed have an out that wont collpse the whole codebase/is opt in for people running separate instances.

## Easy onboarding of new collaborators

- Try to create "easy entry paths" of customization people can try to tackle
- write exhaustive guides to collaboration
- try to organize events for the purpose of onboarding more coders in fandom
- onboarding of collaborators should be easy at all levels
- try to create system to accomodate collaborators at all levels of ability. (a diverse set of collaborators makes the product better, but regardless of that we want to be a tide that lifts everyone up).


## Build on open standards and platforms

No app stores stuff or platform that can legally deny their use (so open source projects only in the critical path). a paid solution can be used in the short term if there's a clear path out of it/taken is care to ensure that we do indeed have an out that wont collpse the whole codebase/is opt in for people running separate instances.
a closed solution can be used in the short term if there's a clear path out of it/taken is care to ensure that we do indeed have an out that wont collpse the whole codebase/is opt in for people running separate instances.

## think for long term and scale

even if you dont think its going to need to scale we shod alwaus consider how we would handle the need in case (or why scaling to that growth would be antithetical to oue principles). we dont need to build for scale right away, but we shouldnt be caught off guard by accidental success.

## always consider accessibility

It's important that Boba be accessible to all. This should include neurodiverse, disabled, queer and all genre of people at all income levels, of all faith, races, sizes, identities and interests.

In the kickstart phase it might not always be possible to prioritize the needs of everyone (for example, making Boba work on low-end devices/connections at this stage would require architectural work we dont have resources for). With that said, "cutting corners" should always be a conscious choice, and should always be done with an eye towards facilitating that type of work when the right time (which should be actively sought) comes.
