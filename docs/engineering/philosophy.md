# Philosophy (draft)

This page documents the principles leading our engineering choices. It's an extreme WIP.

## Keep costs low

- As little required "paid software" as possible
  - This is also helpful for people running their own separate instances.
- No relying on closed-source things/products that can be taken away from us

## Easy onboarding of new collaborators

- Try to create "easy entry paths" of customization people can try to tackle
- write exhaustive guides to collaboration
- try to organize events for the purpose of onboarding more coders in fandom
