# Recommended Tools

While there is no obligation to use these tools, here's a rundown of the editor many contributors prefer and some resources to make it work more smoothly for you - both in general, and with BobaBoard in particular.

## Recommended Editor

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Basically the modern standard for code editors. Great code completion, GitHub integration, and Typescript working out of the box.

### Recommended VSCode Extensions

- [**ESLint**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint): ESLint will automatically warn you when you use JavaScript/React constructs that are wrong or prone to errors.
- [**Prettier**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): Prettier automatically formats your code to follow the standards of the BobaBoard codebase.
- [**Styled-JSX Language Server**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Divlo.vscode-styled-jsx-languageserver) & [**Styled-JSX Syntax Highlighting**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Divlo.vscode-styled-jsx-syntax): Enable CSS highlighting and autocompletion for BobaBoard's CSS library.
- [**Visual Studio Intellicode**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode): Get good typescript code suggestions with AI.
