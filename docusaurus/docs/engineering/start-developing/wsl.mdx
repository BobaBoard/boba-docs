# The BobaBoard Guide to Installing WSL

## Guide Introduction

This guide is designed to gather the best resources on setting up WSL to make it
as painless as possible, including explicit instructions for what to install and
where to install it. If you've never used WSL and don't have a current Linux
distro set-up we recommend you follow the guide in order.

If you currently have WSL feel free to skip around as needed. We recommend
running WSL2 with an Ubuntu distro. You can upgrade to WSL2 by following the
[instructions here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#upgrade-version-from-wsl-1-to-wsl-2).
If you're using another Linux distro you can add a second distro by
[following these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#change-the-default-linux-distribution-installed).

:::note

The guide uses the Windows logo <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faWindows} /> to indicate
items that should be installed directly to Windows, while the Linux logo <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLinux} /> indicates items that should be installed into
your chosen Linux distro (Ubuntu).

:::

## What Is WSL?

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets you run a Linux environment directly on
Windows, unmodified, without a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.
Simply put, WSL creates a Linux subdirectory on your system that you can use to
develop software just like you could if you were running Linux.

## WSL Set-up

:::tip

Before you start, we recommend that you install the latest version of Windows
Powershell and Windows Terminal. Windows Terminal automatically integrates with
WSL and offers a command prompt in your Linux distro. The most recent version
should be Powershell 7.x. Follow
[these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#install-wsl-command)
to install the most recent version. If you also have Powershell 5 installed, we
recommend that you uninstall it, as Windows occasionally gets confused
concerning your default terminal.

After that's complete,
[install Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install)
and follow the instructions to set Powershell 7 as your default profile.

:::

1. Complete the instructions in the
   [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#install-wsl-command)
   section.

2. Set-up your Linux username and password by
   [following these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-your-linux-username-and-password).

3. Follow the
   [instructions here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#upgrade-version-from-wsl-1-to-wsl-2)
   to upgrade from WSL to WSL2.

4. [Upgrade and update Ubuntu packages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#update-and-upgrade-packages).

**Congrats! You've now installed WSL2 with an Ubuntu distro!**

:::tip

You might need to restart so that Windows fully recognizes your WSL. If at any
point, your WSL behaves strangely by not recognizing that
languages/packages/programs have been installed, a restart usually fixes that.

:::

## Installing BobaBoard Pre-requisites

:::caution

**DO NOT** skip over installing a pre-requisite listed below just because it is
installed on your Windows side. WSL will not be able to access things like git,
NodeJS, etc, if they are only installed on Windows. Please follow the
instructions below _carefully_.

:::

### <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLinux} /> Installing Git

1. Open your Linux distro (Ubuntu) from the Start Menu, or if you're already in
   Windows Terminal, open a Linux (Ubuntu) profile shell.

2. If you updated your Ubuntu packages by following the install instructions
   above, you can skip this step. Otherwise run:

   ```bash   showLineNumbers
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

3. Once your updates are complete, install Git by running:

   ```bash   showLineNumbers
   sudo apt-get install git-all
   ```

4. Verify the install with:
   ```bash   showLineNumbers
   git version
   ```

### <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLinux} /> Installing nvm and NodeJS

We highly recommend installing nvm (node version manager), which allows you to
install and use multiple versions of NodeJS in various environments without
issue.

1. In your Linux shell, run the below command to install nvm.

   ```bash   showLineNumbers
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. Use the below command to install the latest version of Node 16, which is
   required by the BobaBoard codebase.

   ```bash   showLineNumbers
   nvm install 16.19.0
   ```

:::tip

If your terminal doesn't recognize the nvm command, try closing your terminal
and reopening it. If that fails, you may need to restart Windows.

:::

### <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLinux} /> Installing yarn

Yarn is a package installer and manager for projects. Now that you have NodeJS
you can install yarn using npm.

1. In your Linux shell, run:

   ```bash   showLineNumbers
   npm install --global yarn
   ```

### <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faWindows} /> Installing Docker

Docker runs programs in containers and is used by BobaBackend to run the
database on your local server. Docker should be installed on **Windows** and not
on WSL. Please be sure to install via the link below, to ensure you are
installing the correct version of Docker.

1. Follow the Windows instructions for installing Docker for WSL
   [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers#install-docker-desktop).

**Congrats! You've installed all the BobaBoard pre-requisites!**

## Prepping to Set-up the BobaBoard Environment

Before you begin to set-up the local BobaBoard environment, you'll need to
create a folder on your WSL to use for your repos.

:::caution

WSL does not like it if you create or delete folders using file explorer. The
majority of your navigation through the WSL file tree will be done via the
terminal. For help with useful terminal commands see the
[Quick Command Line Guide](#quick-command-line-guide) below.

:::

1. In your Linux shell type:

   ```bash   showLineNumbers
   mkdir [repo_folder]
   ```

   where `[repo_folder]` is replaced with the name of your folder. You can
   choose whatever you'd like. For example, to name your folder BobaRepos you'd
   type:

   ```bash   showLineNumbers
   mkdir BobaRepos
   ```

2. To move to your new folder type:

   ```bash   showLineNumbers
   cd [repo_folder]
   ```

Now that you've navigated into your directory, you're ready to start cloning the
various BobaBoard repos. See
[Install BobaFrontend](/docs/engineering/start-developing/bobafrontend),
[Install BobaBackend](/docs/engineering/start-developing/boba-backend), or
[Install BobaComponents](/docs/engineering/start-developing/boba-components) for
more details.

:::note

If you're unsure which repos you should install, feel free to reach out to Ms.
Boba or another volunteer in the volunteer server for more guidance!

## Other WSL Tools

The list of tools and extensions below are not required, but will make your life
_much easier_ or more fun when it comes to working with the BobaBoard codebase
and WSL.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)<br />If you already have
  a code editor you use, you're more than welcome to continue using it. However,
  if you're not married to another code editor, we highly recommend VS Code. It
  has robust Github support, a vast extension library, and works well with WSL
  by recognizing projects which are stored in your WSL directory and
  automatically using a Linux terminal inside the editor (if you use the
  extension below).

  :::info

  When prompted to **Select Additional Tasks** during installation, be sure to
  check the **Add to PATH** option so you can easily open a folder in WSL using
  the `code` command.

  :::

  :::tip

  If you have extensions you like to use in Windows which you would like to use
  in WSL, navigate to the Extensions panel, and click the cloud download next to
  the `WSL: Ubuntu - Installed` title. This will re-install all of your local
  extensions to WSL.

  :::

- [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)<br />Add
  the Remote Development extension to open any folder in a container, on a
  remote machine, or in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and take advantage
  of VS Code's full feature set.

- [Project Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.project-manager)<br />Once
  you open a folder in WSL, you can save it as a project favorite and this
  extension will remember that it's a WSL project and automatically open it
  correctly. In addition, it allows you to switch between coding projects very
  easily without having to use a file explorer or terminal to do so!

- [Tutorial: Set up a custom prompt for PowerShell or WSL with Oh My Posh](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/tutorials/custom-prompt-setup)<br />Want
  a fancy terminal with a custom font, pretty background, or easier to read file
  path? Follow these instructions to jazz it up a bit.

## Quick Command Line Guide

:::note

These commands are the ones you should use in your Linux/Ubuntu terminal in WSL.
In general, when researching what commands to use or how to install things for
WSL, you should be referring to Linux instructions. If you're ever unsure, feel
free to ask in the Volunteer Server and we'll be happy to help!

:::

- `cd [folder_name]` or `cd [path]` **c**hanges **d**irectory to the folder or
  path provided. (Note: For folders with spaces you should enclose the folder
  name with single or double quotes.)

  - `cd ..` moves you up one level in the directory.
  - `cd /` moves you to the root directory.
  - `cd ~` moves you to your home directory. (Note: in WSL, this is your user
    folder.)

- `code .` if you've installed VS Code, this will open your current folder in VS
  Code.

- `ls` lists the files and folders in your current directory.

  - For an exhaustive list of possible flags and options for `ls` see this
    [freeCodeCamp Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-linux-ls-command-how-to-list-files-in-a-directory-with-options/).

- `pwd` prints the current working directory (the path where your terminal is
  currently working). Simply put, this is a "you are here" sign to help you find
  your current location.

- `mkdir [folder_name]` creates a folder with the name provided

- `rm` removes the provided file or folder. Please see the options below for
  more details!

  :::warning

  Deleting files and folders from WSL **DOES NOT** place them into the recycle
  bin. They are permanently deleted when you run the below commands. Please be
  certain you want to delete before you do so!

  :::

  - `rm [file.ext]` deletes the provided file.
  - `rm -d [folder_name]` deletes an empty folder.
  - `rm -r [folder_name]` also called a recursive delete, this command deletes
    every file and subdirectory within the provided folder.
