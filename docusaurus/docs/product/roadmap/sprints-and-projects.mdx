# Sprints and projects

import ProjectCard, {
  getProjectsByTag,
} from "@site/src/components/github/ProjectCard";

export const Projects = (props) => {
  return getProjectsByTag({ tag: props.tag }).map((projectData) => (

BobaBoard's work is currently organized in a series of thematic sprints (e.g. "beta realm launch", "ui polish").

:::warning

I have just thrown a bunch of stuff we had pending here. This page is being worked on right now, and it's not
yet ready for review.
:::

### Current sprints

We're currently working on a schedule of (~6-weeks long) thematic sprints. Here you can see what we're currently working on,
what we have upcoming, and what we're doing later on.

<Projects tag="sprint" />

### Overarching projects

These are big stuff we have ongoing, that don't fit neatly into a single sprint.

- **[P0]:** Volunteer processes
  - **Answering the Q:** What makes for a _great_ volunteering environment?
  - **Current WIPs:**
    - Well-defined positions and expectations.
    - This documentation.
      - Note: documentation includes _both_ code and processes.
    - Standardization of code practices (including cleaning up our REST API).
- **[P0]:** Realms
  - **Preliminary Phase (now)**:
    - Update BobaBoard's REST API (and DB schema) to support multiple communities coexisting on the same instance (Galaxy).
  - **Building Phase (soon)**:
    - Add administration features needed for admins without access to underlying DB.
      - TODO: define features needed -> figure out open UX questions -> figure out base components to build out -> figure out new REST API endpoints -> figure out frontend changes -> parallelize building/solving these as much as possible -> ??? -> profit.
    - Figure out recruitement strategy/selection process.
      - What do we want to learn?
      - Which guarantees do we offer in terms of availability/reliability/ability to help solve conflicts or issues?
        - Share detailed product roadmaps with stakeholders to help make informed choice.
      - What is our responsibility? What is the Realm's admin responsibility?
        - This phase of growth must really stress the _allies_ part of the whole deal.
  - **Explorative Phase (god, i wish i knew)**:
    - Discoverability
    - "Feeds"
    - Cross-realms identity management

### Current "As We See Fit" Areas

- **[P1]:** Performance
  - "Quick" win areas: splitting JS bundle, client-side caching, image CDN (including appropriate sizing and availability in "smaller" formats), React Concurrent Mode (when available)
    - Note: these are quick wins in the sense that they're likely to have a disproportionate impact on performance. They're not necessarily quick to implement.
- **[P1]:** Error Reporting, Management and Avoidance
  - We did add observability instrumentation, though it's currently limited to the backend.
  - _Testing testing testing_
    - Backend testing is the most mature of the bunch (includes integration with CircleCI)
    - We _really_ need to work on frontend testing
      - Adding tests is a good entry point for code volunteering, as it should be fairly easy to look at what other tests are doing and copy it, even without in-depth JavaScript proficiency.
- **[P1]:** Code clean up and modularization
  - Create self-contained, well-standardized entry points for contributions
    - Example: adding new types of permissions, adding new options on post/comments dropdowns, adding new features to the editor, adding more cosmetic customization on boards/realms/etc.
    - Expansion of these features should be possible with only a superficial understanding of the codebase. Assume most volunteers will want to build a quick feature and "go on their way".
      - Hypothesis: people are more likely to stick around for larger projects if they can get a "quick win" under their belt first.
