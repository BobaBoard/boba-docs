# Priorities and status

_Last updated: March 23th, 2023_

**Current phase:** pre-beta.

This page offers a global overview of BobaBoard's current roadmap. You can also check out [our active sprints and projects](./sprints-and-projects)
for more specific details.

## Current priorities

The next step in BobaBoard's journey is to leave the safe nest of a single community and broaden up our reach.

To do this, we're facing two major blockers:

1. **Technological:** the BobaBoard software must be ready to support multiple communities coexisting
   in the same "installation" (done ‚úÖ), and community managers must have access to a baseline level of
   functionality that allows them to manage the community without Ms Boba's _continuous_ intervention
   (in progress üí®).
2. **Organizational:** the BobaBoard organization must be able to coordinate one (or more) team of
   volunteers maintaining and extending its functionality (never "done", but encouragingly successful ‚úÖ),
   as well as finding the right community managers to further grow the community (in progress üí®) and
   to help us define policies and processes that reflect our values and commitments to our user base
   (just started üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).

   Furthermore, the BobaBoard organization must reach some level of financial sustainability.

Maintaining a social network is hard work, and any project is at high risk of failure or "progress stallmate"
without a strong team (and processes) backing it. While the technological challenges are important, it's
the organizational effort that will make or break the project.

## Next up

As of October 2022, we're currently undergoing a "ramp-back-up" sprint‚Äîcodenamed [Annoyances Be Gone](https://github.com/orgs/BobaBoard/projects/5)‚Äîmeant
to give volunteers and Ms Boba the chance to work some rust off after the forced break. During this sprint, we're solving some of the
most common annoyances users and developers face on their BobaBoard journey, while defining and improving even more of our
processes.

After this phase is over, we'll go back to working on Realms, and begin to focus on finding the right community managers
to lead our further expansion.
