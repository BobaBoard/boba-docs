## Your Quickstart Guide

Becoming a volunteer is often overwhelming! In the spirit of helping people get
set up for success, here's a list of things to do after officially
becoming a volunteer:

- [ ] Join our Discord server and get your Team roles.
- [ ] Get (optionally) assigned an "Onboarding Senpai" to ask questions to.
- [ ] Walk through the onboarding guide for the team you're joining.
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with existing tasks for your team and how they
      are assigned.
- [ ] Hang out with other volunteers in the server, or lurk to your
      heart's content.
- [ ] Ask questions if you're lost.
- [ ] Choose a task, work on it, and get it submitted!

## Getting Help

### Onboarding Senpais

An Onboarding Senpai is a dedicated, established member of the BobaBoard volunteering
team that can help you find the answers to any question, and unblock you should
you get stuck. While asking questions in any of our volunteering channels is always welcome,
sometimes you might benefit from a more personalized and private chat. Feel free to
reach out to your senpai with anything you might need!

Your senpai will also proactively reach out to you to make sure everything
is going smoothly, both after "first contact" and after you've been assigned
your first task. This check in will happen:

- When you start volunteering: You can reach out to your senpai as soon as
  they're assigned. If they don't hear from you within a week they'll contact you first.
- Approximately 2 weeks after you start volunteering (or after you've been assigned your first task)
- Approximately 1 month after you start volunteering (or after you've been assigned your first task)
- Approximately 2 months after you start volunteering (or after you've been assigned your first task)

The check-ins are just to make sure you don't fall through the cracks, and there's
no obligation to have finished any task at those times.
