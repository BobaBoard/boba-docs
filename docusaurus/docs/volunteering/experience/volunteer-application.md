### Q: I signed up for volunteering but never received a reply!

First of all, sorry about that! As Ms. Boba is the only person manning this
ship, applications have sometimes slipped through the cracks.

We're currently in the process of creating a more robust volunteers management
process. In the meantime, if you're bursting at the seams to get started, you
can follow up with her via [email](mailto:ms.boba@bobaboard.com).
