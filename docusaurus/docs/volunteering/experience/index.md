## Why Volunteer

As part of volunteering with us, you'll get to:

- Help create independent, online community spaces
- Shape the processes and culture of an up-and-coming organization trying to
  make a difference in the web
- Join a non-judgmental community of fandom people who understand the struggles
  of being a modern online fan
- Apply skills you have or grow new ones in a supportive environment
- Build a portfolio of contributions to open source software and projects in a
  fandom-focused environment different from traditional open source spaces
- Choose your own adventure/level of involvement:
  - Mentor or get mentored
  - Lead new projects or join existing ones
  - Move around tasks and teams—try stretching your skills or stay in your
    comfort zone
  - Learn at your pace—for your enjoyment or to level up your coding career

## The Ideal Volunteer

Below are some common traits of our most successful volunteers or are traits
they aspire to/are working towards. The list is extensive, and you aren't
required to meet them all every day and in every situation, because no one is
perfect! However, if you find yourself frequently thinking you can't or don't
want to do these things while reading the list, BobaBoard may not be a good
cultural fit for you.

Highlight the must haves

:::

### General Traits

- Can communicate in written English (imperfect English is welcome!)
- Comfortable with a diverse environment in terms of background, culture, fandom
  experience and interests, gender, sexuality, identity, skills and more
- Comfortable with mentions of sex and sexuality as they happen within fandom
  spaces
- Perseveres when things get difficult or stressful

### Environmental Fit

- Is ok with a work-in-progress environment where fast-paced change is the norm
- Willing to learn, grow, and try new things to make each iteration better than
  the previous one with an understanding that we take a long-term view and
  approach to what we're building
- Help us with learning to balance the seriousness of an ambitious project with
  the whimsical nature of being in a fandom environment
- Thrives in a non-hierarchical environment where no one can **force** you (or
  others!) to complete tasks or change certain behaviors... or willing to ask
  for the support they need to do so
- Communicates and advocates for themselves and is willing to put in the work
  to help shape the space to meet their needs

### Team Relationships

- Trusts and respects people who share this journey with them
- Receives feedback gracefully while giving it respectfully and constructively
- Extends grace when others make mistakes and approaches the discussion of
  issues with a blameless mindset
- Knows their needs and limitations. Assesses whether a given task/project is a
  good fit for them. Is willing to ask for help when needed, but recognizes and
  mentions when a wrong assignment has been made

## Volunteering Expectations

:::TODO

Rewrite this section!

:::

While BobaBoard strives to embody the chaotic and transgressive spirit of some
corners of transformative fandom, **we expect volunteers and staff to approach
their roles and tasks with seriousness and respect**, and to familiarize
themselves with our [code of conduct](/docs/volunteering/team/code-of-conduct).

**Active and clear communication is the most important quality of a successful
volunteer**. This means volunteers are expected to:

- Asks questions early and often.
- Communicate problems as soon as possible.
- Proactively let us know how we can help make their experience better, or
  smooth out problems for them.

If life or other issues get in the way of a commitment you've made, <ins>let us

**This project is fully committed to diversity, equity and inclusion.** If we
can provide accommodations to improve your experience (such as breaking down
tasks, or more regular check-ins), let us know. If you have concerns, you can
report them to Ms. Boba.
