## Why Volunteer

As part of volunteering with us, you'll get to:

- Help create independent, online community spaces
- Shape the processes and culture of an up-and-coming organization trying to
  make a difference in the web
- Join a non-judgmental community of fandom people who understand the struggles
  of being a modern online fan
- Apply skills you have or grow new ones in a supportive environment
- Build a portfolio of contributions to open source software and projects in a
  fandom-focused environment different from traditional open source spaces
- Choose your own adventure/level of involvement:
  - Mentor or get mentored
  - Lead new projects or join existing ones
  - Move around tasks and teams—try stretching your skills or stay in your
    comfort zone
  - Learn at your pace—for your enjoyment or to level up your coding career

## Volunteering Expectations

:::TODO

Rewrite this section!

:::

While BobaBoard strives to embody the chaotic and transgressive spirit of some
corners of transformative fandom, **we expect volunteers and staff to approach
their roles and tasks with seriousness and respect**, and to familiarize
themselves with our [code of conduct](/docs/volunteering/team/code-of-conduct).

**Active and clear communication is the most important quality of a successful
volunteer**. This means volunteers are expected to:

- Asks questions early and often.
- Communicate problems as soon as possible.
- Proactively let us know how we can help make their experience better, or
  smooth out problems for them.

:::tip

If life or other issues get in the way of a commitment you've made, <ins>let us
know</ins>! We'll reassign the task with no judgement.

:::

**This project is fully committed to diversity, equity and inclusion.** If we
can provide accommodations to improve your experience (such as breaking down
tasks, or more regular check-ins), let us know. If you have concerns, you can
report them to Ms. Boba.
