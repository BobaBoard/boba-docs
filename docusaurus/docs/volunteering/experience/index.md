- Apply skills you have or grow new ones in a supportive environment while making a real difference in the online world
- Join a supportive, non-judgmental community of online fandom people who understand the struggles of being an online fan in this day and age
- Help shape the processes and culture of a up and coming organization trying to make a difference in the web
- Build a portfolio of contribution to open source software and projects in a fandom-focused environment different from traditional open source spaces
- Choose your own adventure/level of involvement:
  - Mentor or get mentored
  - Lead new projects or join existing ones
  - Move around tasks and teams, try stretching your skills or stay in your comfort zone
  - Learn at your pace, for your enjoyment or to level up your coding career

## The volunteering expectations

While BobaBoard strives to embody the chaotic and transgressive spirit of some corners of transformative fandom, **we expect volunteers and staff to approach their roles and tasks with seriousness and respect**, and to familiarize themselves with our [code of conduct](/docs/volunteering/team/code-of-conduct).

**Active and clear communication is the most important quality of a successful volunteer**. This means volunteers are expected to:

- Asks questions early and often.
- Communicate problems as soon as possible.
- Proactively let us know how we can help make their experience better, or smooth out problems for them.

**This project is fully committed to diversity, equity and inclusion.** If we can provide accommodations to improve your experience (such as breaking down tasks, or more regular check-ins), let us know. If you have concerns, you can report them to Ms. Boba.
