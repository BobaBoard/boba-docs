# Volunteering

:::danger Excuse Our Mess

We're in the process of rearranging our volunteering information and updating
them for you. Please excuse our mess. If anything looks particularly wrong
(broken links, broken formatting, etc), please let us know. Current volunteers
should `@enigmalea` in the Volunteer server with what you've found. If you're
not yet a volunteer, please send ms. boba an email at
[ms.boba@bobaboard.com](mailto:ms.boba@bobaboard.com) to give us a heads-up.

:::

:::tip

**This guide and the surrounding processes are a living document.** Volunteers
and other BobaBoard stakeholders are empowered to propose changes, adjustments
and additions.

:::

Thank you for your interest in volunteering for BobaBoard! Community
contributions are vital to the success of the project, and we're looking forward
to welcoming you onboard.

This guide serves as a starting point to familiarize yourself with the BobaBoard
volunteering process and environment.

## The Volunteering Experience

While still in its inception, **the BobaBoard volunteering process aims to be a
supportive entry point into open source development**, empowering fandom folks
to actively contribute to and shape the online communities they inhabit.

The goal of both staff and volunteers is to create spaces and processes that
enable:

- A welcoming and enriching experience for beginners and experts alike.
- An encouraging, judgement-free environment to develop new skills in, or to
  hone pre-existing ones.
- The opportunity for motivated individuals to make an impact and to have their
  contributions publicly recognized to the extent they're comfortable with.
- A leadership style mindful of the experience of marginalized communities,
  proactive in addressing their needs, and supportive of proposed changes within
  the boundaries of its [code of conduct](./volunteering/code-of-conduct).

**Reaching and upholding these goals is a collective, continuous effort.** If
you wish to propose changes, believe we're falling short of our commitments, or
have other concerns, you can open an issue on GitHub, contact Ms. Boba, or take
advantage of our anonymous volunteering feedback form.

:::TODO

[Ms Boba] Create an anonymous volunteers feedback form, and a standard "how to
discuss X" template.

## The volunteering expectations

While BobaBoard strives to embody the chaotic and transgressive spirit of some
corners of transformative fandom, **we expect volunteers and staff to approach
their roles and tasks with seriousness and respect**, and to familiarize
themselves with our [code of conduct](./volunteering/code-of-conduct).

**Active and clear communication is the most important quality of a successful
volunteer**. This means volunteers are expected to:

- Asks questions early and often.
- Communicate problems as soon as possible.
- Proactively let us know how we can help make their experience better, or
  smooth out problems for them.

:::tip

If life or other issues get in the way of a commitment you've made, <ins>let us
know</ins>! We'll reassign the task with no judgement.

:::

**This project is fully committed to diversity, equity and inclusion.** If we
can provide accommodations to improve your experience (such as breaking down
tasks, or more regular check-ins), let us know. If you have concerns, you can
report them to Ms. Boba.

## The volunteering process

:::caution

We're currently focusing our efforts on improving the volunteering process **for
tech volunteers**. Other types of volunteers are still invited to reach out.

:::

1. **[Fill the tech volunteering form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdCX2_fZgIYX0PXeCAA-pfQrcLw_lSp2clGHTt3uBTWgnwVSw/viewform)**
   to get access to our volunteers Discord server and our test community while
   BobaBoard is still in its closed alpha phase.
2. **[Familiarize yourself with BobaBoard codebases.](./engineering/intro)**
   BobaBoard's architecture is modular by design. If you're particularly
   interested in a specific area of work, follow the corresponding instructions
   to install a local copy.
3. **Familiarize yourself with the current roadmap and focus areas.**
   Volunteering expectations may vary according to the urgency of the task. If
   you're an expert developer with short-term availabilty, you're welcome to
   help with issues in the critical path. Beginners may want to start with
   improvements in non-urgent areas of focus.

   :::warning

   This is an active area of development. Check back later for instructions, and
   contact Ms. Boba in the meanwhile!

   :::

4. **Select a first issue.** Contact Ms. Boba for help selecting an issue that
   meets your goals and requirements.

   :::TODO

   [Ms. Boba] Create an open process to select issues.

   :::

5. **Keep in touch.** Periodically update your status with any progress done.

   :::TODO

   [Ms. Boba] Create an open process for status check-ins.

   :::

6. **Open a Pull Request and get your hard work merged in.** Use your GitHub
   account to submit your changes for review. After approval, the changes will
   be merged in the BobaBoard codebase.

   Some tasks might span multiple Pull Requests. If that is the case, after
   marking the reviewed step complete in the corresponding issue, go back to
   step 5. Once all work is complete, it's time for step 7.

7. **Pat yourself on the back.** You did it! Let Ms. Boba know how you want to
   be credited for your hard work: your code contribution will be merged in with
   the next release.

   At this stage, you can either select a new issue to work on, or chill for a
   bit. In the latter case, you're still welcome to still hang around
   BobaBoard's volunteer spaces, and jump into discussions and conversations as
   you see fit.
