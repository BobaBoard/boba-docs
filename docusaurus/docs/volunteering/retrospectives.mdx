# Retrospectives

After a sprint or other significant effort, the BobaBoard team usually holds a retrospective to discuss what went well,
what didn't, and how we can improve in the future.

## What is a retrospective

A retrospective is a meeting (or, in our case, "a thread") where volunteers involved in a project reflect
on the work done, and surface both positive and negative experiences. The goal of a retrospective is not to
air grievances and assign blame, but to improve the experience of those involved in future projects by
identifying areas that are working well and areas that need rethinking.

At the end of a retrospective, the team should have some answers to the following questions:

1. What have we learned that we didn't know before?
2. What has worked well during this effort (and thus should be continued)?
3. What has NOT worked well during this effort (and thus should be changed)?

### The retrospective mindset

The most important point to internalize is that **retrospectives are a blameless process**. Given a problem
that happened, the goal of a retrospective is not to identify who caused it and whether they should have
behaved differently, but what—_other than people being perfect all the time_—could have been done to
prevent the issue from happening, or to lessen its impact.

In our own process, we especially value ["The Prime Directive of Retrospectives"](https://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=The_Prime_Directive):

> Regardless of what we discover, **we understand and _truly believe_ that everyone did the best job they could**,
> given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and
> the situation at hand.

Note that this does not mean that people are not responsible for their actions, or that people who consistently
cause problems should not be held accountable. However, a retrospective is not the place to do so.

## Retrospectives in practice

### Before a retrospective

A retrospective is usually scheduled a few days after the end of an effort. In the time between the end of the
effort and the retrospective, volunteers should:

1. **Reflect on the effort** and think about what went well and what didn't, both in their personal work and
   in the team effort as a whole. It's important to think about both positive and negative experiences.
2. **Prepare points to bring up** during the retrospective, ideally in written form. It's common to forget
   about issues during the retrospective itself, and a list can be very helpful.
3. **Think about actionable improvement** that could have helped mitigate some of the issues. It's important
   that improvements be framed not in terms of changing people's behavior, but in terms of changing the
   underlying process that led to the issue.

If you can't think of anything, that's ok! Just come to the retrospective, listen to what others have to say,
and be ready to share your thoughts.

### During a retrospective

1. **Ms Boba starts a retrospective thread**, and pings everyone involved in the effort.
2. Ms Boba shares the agenda for the retrospective, and reminds everyone of the purpose and mindset of the
   retrospective.
3. **Everyone shares their thoughts on what went well and what didn't**, and we look for common themes.
4. Once the main issues have been identified, we discuss actionable improvements that could have helped
   mitigate them.
5. Ms Boba summarizes the discussion, and **we decide on a few actionable improvements to implement in the
   next sprint**.

:::note
During a retrospective, try to refrain from using the word "you". Instead of saying—or thinking!—_"you should
have done X"_, it's important to frame the discussion as _"we should have done X"_. This helps keep the
retrospective focused on collective improvement rather than individual blame.

### After a retrospective

A succesful retrospective should result in a few actionable improvements that can be implemented in the
future, ideally in the very next sprint or effort. These improvements should be captured in the appropriate
places, and ideally filed as issues in our repositories when applicable.
