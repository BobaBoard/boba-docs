We're currently in the early(ish) stages of figuring out how to organize ourselves effectively. Expect
things to be incomplete or change unexpectedly.

## How we assign roles

![TODO: alt text](./wedont.png)

While we're still in the process of setting things up, we plan to use the Teal Organization framework.
In this framework, roles are not strictly assigned or fixed. When you join you will ample freedom to
choose your first task, as well as subsequent ones. If you want to try your hand at a task that is
managed by a different team, that's totally fine! All we ask is that you follow the advice process, and
talk with involved people about what is needed for such a task as well as listening to their feedback.

Once you start volunteering, you'll always be welcome to come and go according to your availability and
interest. In this framework there is a lot of flexibility to carve your own roles and tasks, or offer
to help people working on theirs.

## Coding Team

The coding team is our longest running team. We have been through a few iterations of our processes,
and have learned some things in the process.

We periodically run sprints where we code together and are trying to get better at assigning tasks
and delivering full fledged features. Our current focuses are TBD.
