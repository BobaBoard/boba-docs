This guide will show you how to edit boba-docs, the website that you're looking
at _right now._

You will need:

- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account. (A brief explanation of GitHub is
  available in our
  [Knowledge Base](/docs/volunteering/coding/github/understanding-github). Any
  `git terminology` use in this guide is also explained there.)

You will NOT need:

- Any knowledge of command lines.

## Step 0: Create your own copy of boba-docs

Only the BobaLord is allowed to modify the original copy of boba-docs. To make
changes, you'll have to your own copy of the files. This process is called
forking, and you can read more about it in our
[knowledge base](/docs/volunteering/coding/github/understanding-github).

**If you already have a copy of boba-docs, skip to
[Keeping your files updated](#keeping-your-files-updated).**

Here are the steps to do this:

1. Make sure you're logged in to GitHub.
2. Navigate to the main repo for the site at
   [https://github.com/essential-randomness/boba-docs](https://github.com/essential-randomness/boba-docs).
   (You can also get there by clicking the "GitHub" link on the top right corner
   of the boba-docs site!)
3. Click the "Fork" button on the top right corner of the page.
4. You will be automatically redirected to your copy of the files. You can
   double-check that you're on your copy by checking the name of the git repo on
   the top left of the page. It should say `[USERNAME]/boba-docs` with
   `forked from essential-randomness/boba-docs` in smaller text under it.

By the way! To do this right, you'd also need to branch. Read our
[knowledge base](/docs/volunteering/coding/github/understanding-github) to learn
more about branching.

### Keeping your files updated

As more and more people edit boba-docs, the main repo will be updated, including
changes that your repo doesn't have. Not to worry! GitHub will prompt you when
this occurs. All you need to to is click the "Fetch upstream" dropdown on your
main repo page, click "Fetch and merge", and GitHub will do the rest.

## Step 1: Open the page in GitHub's editor

Now that you have your own copy of the files, all you have to do to edit the
pages in boba-docs is edit those files. GitHub has a built-in editor that makes
this easy to do. Here's how you get to it:

1. Start by opening the page you want to edit in your browser.
2. Scoll down and click the green "Edit this page" link at the bottom of the
   page. An editor will open. _Do not use this editor._
3. Edit the URL of the editor page by replacing `essential-randomness` with your
   GitHub username. Going to the edited URL will open the same editor, but using
   your copy of the files. _Use this editor._ Like before, you can tell you're
   in the right place if `[USERNAME]/boba-docs` appears on the top left.

Remember how the last tip mentioned branching? That last bullet is there to keep
you from accidentally creating a branch (something outside the scope of this
guide). If you do create a new branch and need to delete it, see the
[appendix](./editing-boba-docs-appendix/#deleting-a-branch) for how to do that.

## Step 2: Make your edits

To edit pages in boba-docs, you need to use Markdown. **Markdown** is a widely
used system for formatting text. If you've typed asterisks into Discord to
italicize something, you've used markdown.

[**Here is a cheat sheet guide to markdown syntax.**](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
That site also includes more detailed information about the system. Please keep
it, or any other guide, handy as a reference while you work.

We will now focus on things specific to GitHub's editor.

![a screenshot of github's editor with red arrows pointing to the preview and markdown guide buttons](/img/volunteer/bobadocseditor.jpg)

On the bottom right of the editor is a button with an M next to an arrow
pointing down. This is short for "markdown", and clicking the button will direct
you to
[GitHub's Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/),
another good reference.

On the top left of the editor is a "Preview" tab, which will let you look at
your work before saving it.

![a screenshot of github's editor preview. a red arrow is pointing to the "show diff" button](/img/volunteer/bobadocspreview.jpg)

Use this tab often. Clicking the "Show diff" button on the top right of preview
will highlight the changes you've made to the file, making it easy to see what
you've done so far. Use show diff often.

<Aside type="tip">

Notice how GitHub's preview doesn't look exactly the same as the page on
Docusaurus? That's because Docusaurus makes use of tools that GitHub's editor
doesn't, such as HTML or page metadata at the top of the file. If you're going
to use these in GitHub's editor, take extra care and leave plenty of space
between different elements to avoid errors.

</Aside>

Once you're satisfied with your changes, it's time to save them. Scroll down the
page.

![a screenshot of github's commit form. red arrows are pointing at the input textboxes and submit button](/img/volunteer/bobadocscommit.jpg)

Title your changes, and write a description for them. Once you're satisfied with
that, click the "Commit" button to save the changes. After saving your changes,
click back to the main page of your repo.

![a screenshot of github's repo page, with a red arrow pointing to the pull request button](/img/volunteer/bobadocsaftercommit.jpg)

You'll notice that GitHub has noticed that you made changes. If you want to edit
more than one page, repeat Steps 1 & 2 for each page you want to edit. Once
you've made all the changes you want to make to all the pagess you want to make
them to, it's time to submit those changes to the BobaLord for review.

## Step 3: Submit your changes

GitHub lets users submit changes to the main repo through a `pull request`.
Clicking the "Compare & pull request" button on your repo will send you to the
page where you do this.

![github's pull request page. red arrows are pointing to the branch selection, details textboxes, and submit button](/img/volunteer/bobadocspullrequest.jpg)

Here's how you submit:

1. At the top of the form are some dropdowns for selecting which copies of the
   files to use. They should be filled in automatically.

2. Title your submission.

3. Describe the your changes in the larger textbox. We recommend at minimum a
   summary of what you did at the top, followed by a more detailed list. **In
   your description, please mention that you used this method (editing directly
   in GitHub, meaning that you did not use yarn to test run the site) before
   submitting. This will let us know to double check that everything works
   properly before accepting.**

4. Hit submit! Your changes are now sent!
