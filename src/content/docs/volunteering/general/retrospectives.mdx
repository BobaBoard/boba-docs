After a sprint or other significant effort, the BobaBoard team usually holds a
retrospective to discuss what went well, what didn't, and how we can improve in
the future.

## What is a retrospective

A retrospective is a meeting (or, in our case, "a thread") where volunteers
involved in a project reflect on the work done, and surface both positive and
negative experiences. The goal of a retrospective is to improve the experience
of those involved in future projects by identifying areas that are working well
and areas that need rethinking, without assigning blame to participants for
issues that might have arisen.

At the end of a retrospective, the team should have some answers to the
following questions:

1. What have we learned that we didn't know before?
2. What has worked well during this effort (and thus should be continued)?
3. What has NOT worked well during this effort (and thus should be changed)?
4. What are some actionable improvements that we can try in the future?

### The retrospective mindset

The most important point to internalize is that **retrospectives are a blameless
process**. Given a problem that happened, the goal of a retrospective is not to
identify who caused it and whether they should have behaved differently, but
what—_other than people being perfect all the time_—could have been done to
prevent the issue from happening, or to lessen its impact.

In our own process, we especially value
["The Prime Directive of Retrospectives"](https://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=The_Prime_Directive):

> Regardless of what we discover, **we understand and _truly believe_ that
> everyone did the best job they could**, given what they knew at the time,
> their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at
> hand.

Note that this does not mean that people are not responsible for their actions,
or that people who consistently cause problems should not be held accountable.
However, a retrospective is not the place to do so.

## Retrospectives in practice

A retrospective goes through three phases:

1. Participants list everything that **went well** during the effort
2. Participants list everything that **did not go well** during the effort
3. Participants brainstorm ways to continue and expand the practices in #1 while
   avoiding the mistakes in #2

There's no need to write down long explanations. In our experiences, a list of
bullet points for each section works best! Further insights will naturally
emerge during the discussion.

### Before a retrospective

A retrospective is usually scheduled a few days after the end of an effort. In
the time between the end of the effort and the retrospective, volunteers should:

1. **Reflect on the effort** and think about what went well and what didn't,
   both in their personal work and in the team effort as a whole. It's important
   to think about both positive and negative experiences.
2. **Prepare points to bring up** during the retrospective, ideally in written
   form. It's common to forget about issues during the retrospective itself, and
   a list can be very helpful.
3. **Think about actionable improvement** that could have helped mitigate some
   of the issues. It's important that improvements be framed not in terms of
   changing people's behavior, but in terms of changing the underlying process
   that led to the issue.

<Aside type="note">

Uncovering what went well during an effort is as important as uncovering what
didn't! Awareness of what currently works well helps ensure good practices
aren't forgotten, and increases confidence when making changes.

### During a retrospective

1. **The Retrospective Lead starts a retrospective thread**, and pings everyone
   involved in the effort.
2. The Retrospective Lead shares the agenda for the retrospective, and reminds
   everyone of the purpose and mindset of the retrospective.
3. **Everyone shares their thoughts on what went well and what didn't**, and we
   look for common themes.

   <Aside type="caution">

   While giving feedback is a fundamental part of the retrospective process, it
   is important to do so with kindness and respect. Please be mindful of your
   tone and language!

   </Aside>

4. Once the main issues have been identified, participants discuss actionable
   improvements that could have helped mitigate them.

   <Aside type="caution">

   During a retrospective, try to refrain from using the word "you". Instead of
   saying—or thinking!—_"you should have done X"_, it's important to frame the
   discussion as _"we should have done X"_. This helps keep the retrospective
   focused on collective improvement rather than individual blame.

   </Aside>

5. The Retrospective Lead (or another participant) summarizes the discussion,
   and **participants decide on a few actionable improvements to implement in
   the next sprint**.

### After a retrospective

A successful retrospective should result in a few actionable improvements that
can be implemented in the future, ideally starting with the next sprint or
effort. These improvements should be captured in the appropriate places, and
ideally filed as issues in our repositories when applicable.

Not every change surfaced by a retrospective will be immediately
implemented—sometimes it might never be! Despite this, it's still important to
capture what's discussed. Summaries of past retrospectives can be periodically
reviewed and taken into consideration as new practices emerge, and offer a
blueprint for what to strive for in the longer term.

<Aside type="tip">

If there's a retrospective item you particularly care about seeing implemented,
you should feel empowered to take on some of the work! Ms Boba or other
volunteers will be happy to help you break down the task into manageable pieces,
or figure out any roadblock that might currently exist.

## What if I...

### ...can't think of anything to say?

If you can't think of anything, that's ok! Just come to the retrospective,
listen to the issues and solutions that others bring up, and be ready to share
your thoughts, even if it's simply agreeing or disagreeing.

### ...am not available while the retrospective is happening?

Ms Boba is always available to collect people's thoughts before the
retrospective, and (given permission) will bring them up herself to make sure
they're discussed. If you can't make it to the retrospective, please share your
thoughts with her beforehand.

After the retrospective, a summary should be available for people to catch up
with. Please read the document carefully, and let us know if there are
additional points or thoughts you'd like to share. The retrospective thread
remains open after the meeting itself.

### ...am worried about being the only one giving feedback?

In our experience, seasoned volunteers always have things to discuss during
retrospectives, and newcomers find it less intimidating to share once they see
others . It's unlikely that you'll be the only one giving feedback! Regardless,
a retrospective is valuable even if only one person shares their thoughts, and
we encourage you to do so.

### ...am worried about others taking feedback personally?

Retrospectives are a blameless process that requires team members to trust each
other to give feedback kindly and respectfully, and to receive it with an open
mind and a growth mindset. While emotions are a natural part of the process,
it's important to keep them in check and not let them take over. If you feel
someone is not living up to these expectations, please let the Retrospective
Lead know privately. Likewise, if you feel you're note in the right mindset to
continue a discussion, let Retrospective Lead know so she can redirect the
discussion or call for a break.

If there is an issue you're particularly worried in bringing up, you can also
share it with the Retrospective Lead before the retrospective, and she will
bring it up herself without revealing your identity. We also have an anonymous
feedback form that you can use to share your thoughts.

### ...have an issue I want to bring up outside of the retrospective?

You should always feel free to bring up issues, either in private with Ms Boba,
in the relevant channels, or in our feedback form.

Note that we may not be able to discuss or solve all issues the moment they come
up. If the team has no bandwidth available (for example because urgent work is
currently happening), we may need to postpone the discussion until a more
appropriate time.

Regardless, it's important that your concerns be heard and acknowledged, and
that a plan is made to address them in the future. At the time when the issue is
brought up, Ms Boba will give you an estimate of when the issue can be
discussed, and will follow up with you when the time comes. If that shouldn't
happen, please don't hesitate to ping her!

### Appendix: Why blameless retrospectives?

When a problem happens, it's human tendency to look for someone to blame. While
this is a natural reaction, it's not a productive one: blaming someone for a
problem does not solve the problem, and it does not prevent the problem from
happening again. It also makes people afraid of making mistakes, which
negatively impacts the culture of the project and of the organization as a
whole.

Blameless retrospectives are a way to break this cycle. By focusing on the
process rather than the people, they help participants learn from mistakes and
grow as a team, without feeling the need to hide issues away or look for a
scapegoat. They help us build a culture of trust and respect that makes
participating in our project a positive experience for everyone involved.
