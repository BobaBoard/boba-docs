BobaBoard uses labels to classify issues and feature requests according to a
variety of criteria.

For ease of reference, labels are further divided in the following
macro-categories:

- [**🎨 Thematic labels**](#thematic-labels) indicate the overall theme of the
  issue or feature request.
- [**🐞 Type labels**](#type-labels) indicate the overall theme of the issue or
  feature request.
- [**🛠 Skills labels**](#skills-labels) indicate the technical skills necessary
  to tackle the issue or feature request.
- [**🛶 Size labels**](#size-labels) indicate the amount of work necessary to
  tackle the issue or feature request.
- [**🌤 Difficulty labels**](#difficulty-labels) indicate the overall difficulty
  of the issue or feature request.
- [**📦 Repository labels**](#repository-labels) indicate the repositories the
  issue or feature request touches upon.
- [**⏩ Stage labels**](#stage-labels) indicate the next step in the
  issue-tackling process.
- [**🌟 Special labels**](#special-labels) indicate the issue meets certain
  special criteria.

We also have a set of [**other labels**](#other-labels) that do not fit in these
categories.
