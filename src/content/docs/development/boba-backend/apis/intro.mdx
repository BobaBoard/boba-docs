Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow applications (clients) to
request data or actions from other applications (servers), without being given
full access to all the data and actions that exists on those servers.

{/* ![Example of client/server HTTP request/response exchange](./client-server.excalidraw) */}

In short, **a server's API defines the language ("contract") that client
applications must use to communicate with it**. Most API operations involve
fetching, storing, or updating data.

While there are very few restrictions on how APIs can be defined, boba-backend's
API follows
[a special set of API guidelines](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api)
called REST. **REST APIs allow clients to communicate with a server by "visting"
addresses (URLs) that represent specific resources**, similar to how browsers
access different web pages through their addresses.

Following REST principles has several advantages, including easier
understanding, definition, and scalability of APIs. You can find more details
about the REST principles followed by boba-backend in the
[API guidelines](./API-guidelines) page.

## How a REST API works

REST APIs use the HTTP protocol, which is the same protocol web browsers use to
navigate websites. Specifically, a REST API defines a set of URLs called
'endpoints' that a client (your application) can "visit" to perform operations
or request data.

A REST API also specifies the format of the data the client needs to send for
the operation and the format of the data it will receive in response.

<Aside type="tip" icon="star">

When running `boba-backend` locally, you can send an API request and see an
example of an API response by opening your browser and going to the
[`http://localhost:4200/realms/slug/twisted-minds`](http://localhost:4200/realms/slug/twisted-minds)
URL.

<details>
<summary>Detailed breakdown</summary>

Request details:

- **Server base address:** `http://localhost:4200`
- **API endpoint:** `realms/slug/[:realm_slug]`
- **HTTP Request method:** `GET` (browsers' default)
- **HTTP Request URL parameters:** `{ realm_slug: "twisted-minds" }`

Response details (assuming success):

- **HTTP Response status code:**
  [200 (success)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200)
- **HTTP Response payload:** what you see in the browser
- **HTTP Response type:**
  [See endpoint documentation](/development/rest-api/#tag/realms/operation/getRealmsBySlug)

</details>

</Aside>

When a client makes a request to a REST API, it uses different
[`HTTP methods`](https://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html) to
perform specific operations on the resource associated with an endpoint. When
the server responds to a request, it uses
[`HTTP Status Codes`](https://httpstatuses.com/) to indicate whether the
operation was successful and its result, if any.

Any additional data that needs to be sent or received as part of the request or
response is referred to as the request/response payload. In the case of
BobaBoard's API, the responses are returned in the
[`JSON format`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON).

## REST API example

<Aside type="danger">

**The following examples do not reflect how boba-backend works in practice**,
and are just meant to help understand REST APIs.

The source of truth for the boba-backend API is our
[REST API documentation page](/api/).

</Aside>

As an example, let's define the REST API endpoint that associated with
contributions on a thread. This endpoint will live at the
`/threads/:thread_id/contributions/:contribution_id` address, and support the
following operations:

- **GET:** fetch the contribution data
- **POST:** create a new contribution
- **PUT:** update the contribution
- **DELETE:** delete the contribution

Remember that endpoints often accept only a subset of these operations. Make
sure to check the documentation of the APIs you're using before sending
requests!

<Aside type="tip" icon="star">

For a refresher on HTTP Status codes,
[MDN is your friend](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)!

</Aside>

### GET: Fetch the data for a contribution in a thread

The client wants to **fetch** the contribution with id `contribution_123` in the
thread with id `thread_456`.

To do this, the client sends the following request:

- **Endpoint:** `/threads/thread_456/contributions/contribution_123`
- **HTTP Method:** `GET`

Possible responses include:

- **Success (ok):** An HTTP Status Code of `200` with a `payload` that contains
  the contribution data.
- **Not found:** An HTTP Status Code of `404` if the contribution does not
  exist.
- **Authentication needed:** An HTTP Status Code of `401` if the access requires
  authentication data and none was found in the request.

<Aside type="tip" icon="star">

`GET` requests are the default type of request the browser sends when you access
a web page. This means you can access `GET` endpoints through your browsers!

</Aside>

### POST: Create a new contribution in a thread

The client wants to **create** a contribution with id `contribution_123` in the
thread with id `thread_456`.

<Aside type="caution" title="Contrived example">

In practice, the new contribution id is generated by the server! Take this
example with a grain of salt as it oversimplifies things.

<details>
<summary>How it actually works</summary>

The client sends a `POST` request to the `/threads/thread_456/contributions/`
endpoint, without specifying the id.

When the contribution is created, the server assigns the contribution id. This
id is returned to the client as part of the response `payload`. The client can
then use that id to request further actions on that contribution.

</details>

</Aside>

To do this, the client sends the following request:

- **Endpoint:** `/threads/thread_456/contributions/contribution_123`
- **HTTP Method:** `POST`
- **Payload:** The content of the contribution in the format specified by the
  server.

Possible responses include:

- **Success (created):** An HTTP Status Code of `201` if the contribution was
  successfully created. This might include a `payload` that contains the
  finalized contribution data.
- **Authentication needed:** An HTTP Status Code of `401` if creating the
  contribution requires authentication data and none was found in the request.
- **Conflict:** An HTTP Status Code of `409` if a contribution with the given id
  already exists.

<Aside type="tip" icon="star">

`POST` requests are often used by browsers when submitting forms.

</Aside>

### PUT: Update a contribution in a thread

The client wants to **update** a contribution with id `contribution_123` in the
thread with id `thread_456`.

To do this, the client sends the following request:

- **Endpoint:** `/threads/thread_456/contributions/contribution_123`
- **HTTP Method:** `PUT`
- **Payload:** The content of the updated contribution in the format specified
  by the server.

Possible responses include:

- **Success:** An HTTP Status Code of `201` if the contribution was successfully
  updated. This might include a `payload` that contains the finalized
  contribution data.
- **Authentication needed:** An HTTP Status Code of `401` if updating the
  contribution requires authentication data and none was found in the request.
- **Invalid authentication:** An HTTP Status Code of `403` if the authenticated
  user is not authorized to update the contribution.
- **Not found:** An HTTP Status Code of `404` if the contribution does not
  exist.

<Aside type="tip" icon="star">

`PUT` requests are not easily accessible through browsers! To issue one, you can
use a tool like [Postman](docs/development/boba-backend/using-postman) or write
a test for your endpoint.

</Aside>

### DELETE: Delete a contribution in a thread

The client wants to **delete** a contribution with id `contribution_123` in the
thread with id `thread_456`.

To do this, the client sends the following request:

- **Endpoint:** `/threads/thread_456/contributions/contribution_123`
- **HTTP Method:** `DELETE`
- **Payload:** None

Possible responses include:

- **Success (no content):** An HTTP Status Code of `204` if the contribution was
  successfully deleted.
- **Invalid authentication:** An HTTP Status Code of `403` if the user is not
  authorized to delete the contribution.
- **Not found:** An HTTP Status Code of `404` if the contribution does not
  exist.

`DELETE` requests are not easily accessible through browsers! To issue one, you
