## On the server

[Permission handlers](https://github.com/BobaBoard/boba-backend/blob/main/handlers/permissions.ts)
are a type of custom
[Express middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html). They
fetch permissions from the database and add them to the incoming request.
Optionally, they check whether a specific permissions is present, and
automatically return the `UNAUTHORIZED` status code in the negative case.

### Permissions fetchers

Handlers named `with[Entity]Permissions` (e.g. `withThreadPermissions`,
`withBoardPermissions`) are "permission fetchers". They extract the appropriate
entity id from the request, fetch the corresponding permissions, and add them to
the request object under the key `current[Entity]Permissions`.

Example:

```js
// Update thread route
router.patch(
  "threads/:thread_id",
  ensureLoggedIn,
  withThreadPermissions,
  async (req, res) => {
    const { currentThreadPermissions } = req;
    // currentThreadPermissions now contains the permissions the user has for the thread with id `thread_id`.
  }
);
```

<Aside type="caution">

If the route has no `:thread_id` param, the `withThreadPermissions` handler will
throw an error.

### Generic permission checkers

Handlers named `ensure[Entity]Permission` (e.g. `ensureThreadPermission`,
`ensureBoardPermission`) are generic permission checkers. Each of these handlers
takes a permission as an argument, and checks that the user has the permission
for the given entity. If the permission is not found, the appropriate
`UNAUTHORIZED` status code is automatically returned.

Like permission fetchers, permission checkers add a list of the user's
permissions to the request object under the key `current[Entity]Permissions`.

Example:

```js
// Create new thread on a board
router.post(
  "boards/:board_id",
  ensureLoggedIn,
  ensureBoardPermission(BoardPermissions.createThread),
  async (req, res, next) => {
    // If this handler is reached, the user has the `createThread` permission for the board with id `board_i`.
    // If ensureBoardPermission fails, a response with status 403 is automatically sent back.
  }
);
```

<Aside type="caution">

If the route has no `:board_id` param, the `ensureBoardPermission` handler will
throw an error.

</Aside>

### Complex permission checkers

When checking for the simple existance of a permission is not enough, we can
create a permission checker with more specific logic. These handlers are usually
named `ensure[Condition]` (e.g. `ensureLoggedIn`, `ensureBoardAccess`). Their
semantic is the same as generic permission checkers.

Example:

```js
router.get("feeds/boards/:board_id", ensureBoardAccess, async (req, res) => {
  // If this handler is reached, the user has permission to access the board with id `board_id`.
  // If ensureBoardAccess fails, a response with status 403 is automatically sent back.
});
```

## On the client

Each board's metadata includes the user's permission for the board and all
threads and posts contained within. See the
[`boards/{board_id}`](/docs/development/rest-api/#operation/getBoardsByUuid)
endpoint for details.
