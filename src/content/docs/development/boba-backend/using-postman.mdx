You can send complex HTTP requests to the backend server using the
[Postman API client](https://www.postman.com/product/api-client/). You can
[download Postman here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

To send a request through Postman, you can follow their
["Sending your first request"](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/)
tutorial. A sample BobaBoard URL to use is
`http://localhost:4200/realms/slug/twisted-minds` with the `GET` HTTP method.

You can find all the BobaBoard REST API endpoints in our
[Rest API documentation](/docs/development/rest-api/).

<Aside type="note" title="Important">

When using Postman, make sure that the HTTP method in the request corresponds to
the one required by the API.

### How to authenticate Postman requests

Some requests to the BobaBoard API require authentication.

API endpoints that require authentication have "`firebase`" listed under the
`AUTHORIZATIONS` section in their documentation. They will also return `401` or
`403` errors if accessed by an unauthenticated user.

#### Initial Setup

Before authenticating Postman requests, you will need to set up a Postman
environment.

1. Follow the
   ["variables in Postman"](https://www.javatpoint.com/variables-in-postman)
   guide to set up a Postman environment.

2. Set up a `email` variable in your environment with your BobaBoard login
   email.

3. Set up a `password` variable in your environment with your BobaBoard login
   password.

4. Set up a `firebaseApiKey` variable in your environment with value
   `AIzaSyAYgQGhDsBS6rDKu8PVq_sAQrxt4tIrGEI`.

   <Aside type="note">

   Firebase API keys are designed to be used client-side and are not used to
   control access to backend resources. You can learn more on the
   [Firebase API documentation website](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api-keys).

5. Create (and save) the following **Authentication HTTP Request**

   - **Method:** `POST`
   - **URL:**
     ```
     https://www.googleapis.com/identitytoolkit/v3/relyingparty/verifyPassword?key={{firebaseApiKey}}
     ```
   - **Body**:

     ```javascript showLineNumbers
     {
         "email": "{{email}}",
         "password": "{{password}}",
         "returnSecureToken": true
     }
     ```

     Format: `raw/JSON`

   - **Tests:**

     This is the "Tests" tab in the postman request menu, near the Body one at
     the previous step.

     ```javascript showLineNumbers
     postman.setEnvironmentVariable("authToken", pm.response.json().idToken);
     ```

#### Authenticating Requests

1. Run the **Authentication HTTP Request** request set up in the previous step.
   A successful response will contain an "`idToken`" section with a very long
   string.

2. Go to the request you want to authenticate.

3. Under the **Headers** tab, add a row with the following:

   - **Key:** `Authorization`
   - **Value:** `{{authToken}}`

   Your request should now have the correct authorization header.

   <Aside type="tip" icon="star">

   Your authentication token will expire after an hour. You will need to
   reauthenticate again after that by sending another **Authentication HTTP
   Request**.
