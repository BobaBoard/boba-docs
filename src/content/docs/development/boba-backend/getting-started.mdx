Before continuing with this section, **follow the installation instructions** in
our [Contribute section](/docs/development/start-developing/boba-backend).

## Development Instructions

:::warning

This codebase requires Node **18**. If you're using
[Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), you can switch to version
18 by running `nvm use 18` in your terminal.

You can check the current Node version by running `node -v`.

:::

BobaBackend needs 3 different components to run:

1. The actual server (NodeJS + Express)
2. The database (PostgreSQL)
3. The cache (Redis)

You can choose to run these in the same command, or separately. Unless you're
running tests, you'll likely want to start them all together.

### Quickstart (single command)

:::warning

Make sure you have Docker installed and running

:::

In a terminal, run the following command:

```
yarn run dev
```

### Individual commands

In a terminal, run the following commands:

#### Start the database and the cache

```
yarn run db:start
```

#### Start the server (development mode)

```
yarn run server:dev
```

#### Run tests

:::warning

You should start the database independently before running tests

:::

```
yarn run test
```

## Making sure the server is running

You can test the server is running by opening
`http://localhost:4200/realms/slug/twisted-minds` in any browser. You should now
see a list of all the realm properties in
[JSON format](https://developers.squarespace.com/what-is-json).

:::tip

Accessing a URL through a browser is equivalent to making a GET request to the
same URL through [Postman](/docs/development/boba-backend/using-postman).

:::

:::tip

**The above commands will automatically restart the server on any code change
you make. **

<details>
<summary><strong>How to manually restart the development server</strong>
</summary>

Both of these actions need to be performed on the console where
`yarn run dev:watch` is currently running.

- **Fancy Way:** Type `rs` and press enter.
- **Bruteforce Way:** ~~Press~~ Mash `ctrl+c` to stop the running process, then
  run `yarn run dev` again.
