## Routes Structure

Each REST route in the server is defined through the same folders structure:

- A top-level folder **corresponding to the name of the route** (e.g. `boards/`,
  `posts/,` `users/`)

  - A `sql/` folder, containing `.sql` files for larger queries, and an
    `index.ts` file that encapsulates these files, and exports variables and
    methods resolving to SQL queries. These should be, mostly, self-contained
    logical units corresponding to common DB operations.

    **Note:** some methods build queries dynamically for efficiency (e.g.
    turning what would be repeated calls for "insert a tag in a db" method into
    a single statement). This is not (**_and should never be_**) done by
    concatenating strings. Instead, we use
    [pg-promise helpers](https://vitaly-t.github.io/pg-promise/helpers.html) to
    ensure any dynamic query is built as a
    "[prepared statement](https://medium.com/@jaredablon_31568/how-to-prevent-sql-injection-vulnerabilities-how-prepared-statements-work-f492c369614f)".

  - A `queries.ts` file, containing the interface between the database and the
    final REST API routes. Methods in this file usually combine multiple queries
    exported by `sql/index.ts` into a single operation.

    **Note:** some of these methods are imported by `routes.ts` files in other
    routes. This is not generally discouraged, but queries should be placed
    within the route that is semantically closest to their usage (e.g. a query
    to retrieve board permissions should be placed in the `boards/` route, even
    if it might also be used to check user permissions in `posts/`). Your best
    judgement might be required.

  - A `routes.ts` file which exposes an
    [express.Router](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) object
    representing the route. Endpoints are attached to the route via either the
    `router.get` (data fetch) or the `router.post` (data insert/update) methods.
    The `isLoggedIn` middleware is available for queries dependent on user
    identification. Each route in the `routes.ts` file relies on one or more
    methods in `queries.ts` to expose functionality through REST endpoints. It
    also takes care of checking the validity of users inputs, communicating
    errors through the appropriate
    [HTTP Status Codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).
  - A route _should_ also contain a `tests/` folder for tests. These are
    automatically picked up by `mocha` (our tests suite) when running the
    appropriate commands. Tests are mostly done at the `queries.ts` level, even
    though more `routes.ts` tests should be likely written. When at test file
    becomes too long, it should be separated in logical units (e.g.
    `boards/tests/permissions.test.ts`, `boards/tests/notifications.test.ts`).

Routes added to `all-routes.ts` are automatically picked up by the server upon
start-up.

## How to Run Tests

To run tests, you will first need to start the test DB using
`yarn run start-db`. You can then run the tests in watch mode (which
automatically reruns tests as you update the code) by running
`yarn run test:watch` in a separate terminal tab. The tests will print a lot of
debug logs, followed by a count of passed and failed cases, and a list of
AssertionsErrors for those that didn't succeed. AssertionsErrors indicate that
there was a mismatch between the data that the test expected to encounter, and
what was actually encountered.

**IMPORTANT:** the frontend and the tests act on the same database. If you've
been using a frontend connected to your local dev server to test things out,
then some tests might fail that aren't meant to. Before running tests, make sure
to use CTRL+C to stop your db, and run `yarn run start-db` again.
