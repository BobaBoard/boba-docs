(you can do so through the JavaScript console of your browser of choice):

```jsx
// Print all the debug logs related to the editor
localStorage.debug = "bobapost:*";

// Print only the debug logs related to embeds
localStorage.debug = "bobapost:embeds:*";

// Print only the debug logs related to Twitter embeds
localStorage.debug = "bobapost:embeds:tweet";

// Print all the debug logs minus those ending with -verbose
localStorage.debug = "bobapost:*,-bobapost:*-verbose";

// Print all the debug logs related to the UI Component
localStorage.debug = "bobaui:*";

// Print all the debug logs related to the frontend
localStorage.debug = "boba-frontend:*";

// Print all the debug logs
localStorage.debug = "*";
```
