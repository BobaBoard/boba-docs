title: Visit History

## Problem

Maintain a more detailed history of users' visits to threads. This can be used
to:

1. Display a "visited threads history" page for users.
2. Enable users to see "new post/comment" status for previous visits to a thread
   (in case of accidental refresh, for example).

## Current Status

Visit to threads are stored in the `user_thread_last_visits` table. It has the
following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_thread_last_visits(
    user_id BIGINT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT NOT NULL,
    thread_id BIGINT REFERENCES threads(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT NOT NULL,
    last_visit_time timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX user_thread_entry on user_thread_last_visits(user_id, thread_id);
```

Visits are registered through the `/threads/[thread_id]/visit` endpoint, and the
database update query is defined in
[`server/threads/sql/visit-thread-by-string-id.sql`](https://github.com/BobaBoard/boba-backend/blob/master/server/threads/sql/visit-thread-by-string-id.sql).

## Changes

The main issue is the `UNIQUE INDEX` in the `user_thread_last_visits` table,
which prevents storing multiple visits in the same table. I would suggest
dropping the index, but the `last_visit_time` column would still be a misnomer,
and many queries would need to be updated to change it.

Instead, I propose a completely new `user_thread_visits` table. This would have
a similar schema WITHOUT `unique` constraints and with a more reasonable name
for the `last_visit_time` column (likely `visit_time`). We'd need to create a
`(user_id, thread_id, visit_time)` index to make queries for the latest visit
time faster.

Purposely leaving the queries as an exercise :)

### Implementation plan

1. Create the `user_thread_visits` table.
2. Populate `user_thread_visits` when `/threads/[thread_id]/visit` endpoint is
   called.
3. DO THE MIGRATION STEPS
4. Figure out which queries are using `user_thread_last_visits` and switch them
   to `user_thread_visits`.
   - **Note:** this includes updating the `thread_notification_dismissals` view,
     which needs to be done by querying the DB directly (aka, I will be the one
     doing that).
5. NUKE `user_thread_last_visits` OUT OF EXISTENCE

### Migration steps

1. Deploy the server version writing `user_thread_visits` in addition to
   `user_thread_last_visits`.
2. Dump the `user_thread_last_visits` entries into `user_thread_visits`.
3. Go back to step 4 in implementation plan.

We could technically nuke `user_thread_last_visits` immediately and create a
view as a fallback, but there's only 2-3 queries that rely on it so it's easier
to just do the change all together.

## API endpoints

We should leave the definition of API endpoints to access these values for when
we're ready to implement UI that needs these values. I've learned my lessons.

If we're ready, I would suggest a new `/users/@me/history` endpoint for visits
history, as well as augmenting `threads/[thread_id]/` to return details about
last visits if we want to do fancy notification views.

## Notes

The visit endpoint uses the `GET` HTTP method. This is incorrect (it should be
`POST`). Updating it would be an easy extension to this project.
