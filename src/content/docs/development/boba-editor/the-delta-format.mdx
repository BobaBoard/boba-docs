The Delta format is at the base of QuillJS's text editing capabilities. You can
[read the in-depth guide](https://quilljs.com/docs/delta/) on the QuillJS
website. This introductory overview goes over what you need to understand to
effectively work on BobaEditor.

## What is a Delta?

**A Delta is a presentation-agnostic representation of formatted text.** It
contains everything we need to translate text into a visual format (e.g. HTML)
without implementation-specific details.

The separation of representation and implementation means **changes to
BobaEditor's rendering logic also influence the rendering of older, stored
Deltas**. This makes it possible to change our output (e.g. CSS classes,
rendered HTML elements, JavaScript event handlers) without worrying about
compatibility with previous versions, something that would be extremely hard if
we stored the rendered HTML.

## What does a Delta look like?

In its simplest form (the one eventually stored in the database) a Delta is an
array of insert operations.

<EditorPreview
  text={`
[
    { "insert": "This is a H1 Header" },
    { "insert": "\\n", "attributes": { "header": 1 } },
    { "insert": "You can have various types of formatting, like " },
    { "insert": "inline code", "attributes": { "code": true } },
    { "insert": ", " },
    { "insert": "bold text", "attributes": { "bold": true } },
    { "insert": ", or even " },
    { "insert": "spoilers!", "attributes": { "inline-spoilers": true } },
    { "insert": "!\\n" },
    { "insert": 
      { 
        "block-image": {
          "src": "/img/documentation/cool.png",
          "width": "200",
          "height": "106"
        }
      }
    },
    { "insert": "As seen above ☝️, images and other types of embeds are also supported." }
]`}
/>

## Insert operations

There are three types of insert operations:

- **Inline formatting**: for inline styles (e.g. bold, text spoilers).
- **Line formatting**: for styles applied to the preceding line as a whole (e.g.
  paragraph centering, headings, lists).
- **Embeds**: for non-text content.

### Inline formatting

Inline formatting applies only to the text within a specific insert operation.
The type of formatting is specified through the "attributes" property of the
corresponding insert operation.

<EditorPreview
  text={`
[
    { "insert": "Here's an " },
    { "insert": "example", "attributes": { "italic": true } },
    { "insert": " of " },
    { "insert": "inline ", "attributes": { "bold": true } },
    { "insert": "~styles~", "attributes": 
        { 
          "bold": true, 
          "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
          "italic": true
        }
    }
]`}
/>

#### Custom inline formats

For a practical example of a custom inline styles, you can refer to
[InlineSpoilers.tsx](https://github.com/BobaBoard/boba-editor/blob/master/src/custom-nodes/InlineSpoilers.ts).

The `InlineSpoilers` class extends the `blots/inline` class from Quill. This is
used for inline text that can accept further formatting.

You can
[read more about inline blots](https://quilljs.com/guides/cloning-medium-with-parchment/#basic-formatting)
on the "Cloning Medium with Parchment" example on the QuillJS website.

### Line formatting

Line formatting applies to the whole preceding line, as delineated by the
newline character (`\n`). The type of formatting is specified through the
"attributes" property of the corresponding insert operation, whose textual value
is a single `\n`.

<EditorPreview
  text={`
[
    { "insert": "When a insert operation contains only a single '\\\\n' its attributes apply to the whole previous \\n" },
    { "insert": "line (which can still have " },
    { "insert": "inline attributes", "attributes": { "bold": true } },
    { "insert": ")" },
    { "insert": "\\n", "attributes": { "header": 1 } },
    { "insert": "!" }
]`}
/>

#### Custom line formats

BobaEditor doesn't currently have an example of a custom line formatting
element, which are (in theory, since we've never tried) implemented by extending
the `blots/block` class from Quill. These are used for text formatting
operations that are mutually exclusive (i.e. a `<h1>` element cannot appear
within a `<blockquote>`).

You can
[read more about block blots](https://quilljs.com/guides/cloning-medium-with-parchment/#blockquote-and-headers)
on the "Cloning Medium with Parchment" example on the QuillJS website.

### Embeds

Embeds are complex, non-textual elements. In the case of embeds, the value of
the insert attribute will be an object with a single attribute named after the
type of embed itself. The value of this attribute will be passed to the embed
element for rendering.

<EditorPreview
  text={`
[
    { "insert": "Embeds represent complex non-textual elements, like images:" },
    { "insert": 
      { 
        "block-image": {
          "src": "https://media1.tenor.com/images/4335e4cadbb8ac96f1e888710ebbff08/tenor.gif?itemid=15782429",
          "width": "200",
          "height": "200",
          "spoilers": true
        }
      }
    }
]`}
/>

#### Custom embeds

For an example of how to implement a custom embed, you can look at
[BlockImage.tsx](https://github.com/BobaBoard/boba-editor/blob/master/src/custom-nodes/BlockImage.ts).
This, like other embeds, extends the `blots/block/embed` class from Quill. The
important methods to implement are:

- **`create`**: the entry point of embed rendering. Its only argument is the
  value of the embed attribute specified by the `blotName` property
  (`block-image` in the previous example).

  `create` returns the root DOM node of the embed element, which is created by
  calling `super.create()` and whose node type (e.g. `div`) is determined by the
  `tagName` property.

- **`value`**: given the root DOM node returned by `create`, extracts the value
  of the embed element.

  `value` returns the proprieties that need to be stored to recreate the embed
  during the insert operation (`{src: ..., width: ..., ...}` in the previous
  example).
