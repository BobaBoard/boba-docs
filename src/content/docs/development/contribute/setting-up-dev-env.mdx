This is an overview of the programs you'll need to install before developing for
BobaBoard.

<Aside type="tip" icon="star">

**Developing for BobaBoard requires use of the command line.** While this might
seem scary, the amount of commands needed is minimal and they can often be run
without a deep understanding of them.

If you're intimidated, contact Ms. Boba for help! Also consider editing this
page to make it less scary for newcomers.

## What to Install

### Install Checklist

- [ ] [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](#windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-windows-only)
      [Windows Only]
- [ ] [Git](#git)
- [ ] [NodeJS](#nodejs-with-nvm)
- [ ] [Yarn](#yarn)
- [ ] [Docker](#docker-boba-backend-only) [boba-backend Only]

### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) [Windows Only]

<Aside type="caution">

This is only for Window users. It's optional, but **highly recommended**.
Without this, it might be harder to help you in case of errors.

</Aside>

**[WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) allows you to run
Linux commands on Windows**, and will save you many, many headaches. We
recommend using the latest version of WSL (WSL2). The default Ubuntu
distribution is the most commonly used, but if you're more familiar with another
distribution, you're welcome to use it.

<Aside type="caution">

If you need Docker (see below) and have Windows 10 Home Edition, you **must**
install WSL.

</Aside>

For a step-by-step guide to setting up WSL, installing the below pre-requisites,
and getting set-up to develop for BobaBoard using WSL see
[The BobaBoard Guide to Setting up WSL](/docs/development/start-developing/wsl)

### Git/GitHub

**You will use Git and a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to download the
BobaBoard code, make changes and send them out for review. **You can
[learn more about Git and GitHub](/docs/volunteering/coding/github/understanding-github)
in our knowledge base.

To install git, follow the
[instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git). While this
documentation assumes you're using git through the command line, using GitHub
Desktop or VSCode's Git(Hub) integration might provide an easier experience for
newcomers.

### NodeJS (with NVM)

**NodeJS allows you to execute JavaScript outside of a web browser.** This
should be installed via the
[**Node Version Manager**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (NVM), which allows
you to manage multiple versions of NodeJS on the same machine.

<Aside type="caution">

You can also install NodeJS directly through the installer, but you won't be
able to switch between versions. It is **highly, highly recommended** that you
install NVM.

</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" icon="star">

While NVM isn't natively supported on Windows, you can get access to it through
[WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl).

</Aside>

### Yarn

**[Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) is a JavaScript Package Manager, which
automatically downloads and installs the external code that BobaBoard depends
on**, without you having to manually download everything yourself. Yarn is also
used to hide complex scripts under simpler commands like `yarn run test`.

<Aside type="tip" icon="star">

Using `npm` instead of `yarn` will result in errors. You can blame React for
that.

</Aside>

### Docker [boba-backend Only]

[**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) runs applications
in containers.
[I literally had to Google an ELI5.](https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/9xwlg6/can_anyone_eli5_what_docker_is_and_its_practical/)
Trust me, you don't need to understand Docker to use it.

- You also need [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). This
  comes for free with the above in Windows and Mac, but might need additional
  steps on Linux.

<Aside type="caution">

**[Windows Only]** You should run docker in a WSL2 instance. There's a checkbox
in Docker settings for this. (This is required if you have Windows 10 Home
Edition, and only recommended for other versions of Windows 10.) If Docker is
failing to start, make sure you have WSL2 installed.

</Aside>

Docker will be used to run BobaBoard's
[**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) database and the
[**Redis**](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart) cache without globally
installing them on your system. You can
[learn more about caches](.../../../knowledge-base/caching) in our knowledge
base.

## Next Steps

You can install each codebase independently by following the "fetching
dependencies through yarn" section in its instructions. If you want to "catch
them all", you should go through each of them in reading order and follow the
"local copy" section instead.

## BobaBoard Install Fests

"Install Fests" are events where one or more contributors install the BobaBoard
codebase together and help each other in case of problems. Ms. Boba is also
there on standby for any question that comes up.

While we plan to organize regular install fests in the future, we currently
schedule them on request. You can contact Ms. Boba for availability.
