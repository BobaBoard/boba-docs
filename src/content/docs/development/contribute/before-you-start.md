Before you start, consider reading the [codebase overview](../intro) to
understand the different areas of the project and the technologies used in each
of them.

:::tip

**You don't need to have deep knowledge of all involved technologies/programming
languages to contribute to BobaBoard.** You also don't need to be a
"professional developer".

As long as you're willing to put in the effort to learn, Ms. Boba will be very
happy to guide you in the process. After all, every explanation she gives makes
this documentation better.

:::

:::note

TODO[Ms.Boba]: Create a intro page to help people with a specific skill (or
desire to learn a specific skill) find good entry points to check out issues.

:::

## Step 0 - Sign up for a GitHub Account

In order to submit code, you will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
You can read more about
[Using Github](/docs/volunteering/coding/github/understanding-github).

## Step 1 - Take a look at open issues

You can find open issues in our
[Issues Tracker](https://github.com/BobaBoard/issues/issues). Issues marked
["good first issue"](https://github.com/BobaBoard/issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
are particularly relevant.

:::caution

**The issue tracker is currently a WIP.** Not all open issues are reflected in
it, and some issues and their labels might be out of date or incorrect. If
nothing there strikes your fancy (or you want to know current priorities),
consider contacting Ms. Boba for other options.

:::

## Step 2 - Contact Ms. Boba

Currently, Ms. Boba is the person with the best understanding of the whole
codebase and its state. Once you agree on the issue you're going to be tackling,
she will create a WIP document defining the goal of the projects and the
relevant steps. She will also guide you in installing the relevant codebases.

:::tip

If you want to explore the codebase on your own, look at the Setting up your Dev
Env page.

:::

:::note

TODO[Ms.Boba]: I REALLY should have a "contact me" page.

:::

## Step 3 - Keep in touch (and submit code)

:::important

The main thing we ask volunteers is to _**communicate, communicate,
communicate**_. Unless you specifically request an "urgent" issue (which comes
with different expectations), you'll most likely be assigned a long-term
project. We know things can happen and that life might get in the way, and **we
don't judge contributors for dropping out, or taking longer than planned. We
_just need to know_, so we can plan accordingly.**

:::

Ms. Boba (or another volunteer) will periodically ping you for updates. Just let
her know what's up (including "nothing") and submit a pull request when you're
ready. You can
[learn more about the development lifecycle](../knowledge-base/development-lifecycle)
in our knowledge base.

:::tip

The unstable and early nature of the codebase makes it even more important to
break up your changes in smaller chunks! Ms. Boba can help break down tasks in
manageable pieces!

Ms. Boba is really friendly and loves to info dump! If you're blocked or
confused, reach out to her for help!
