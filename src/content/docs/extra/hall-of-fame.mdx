Funny things that happened in the history of BobaBoard.

## Unexpected Challenges

Webmistress posted
[a Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/BobaBoard/status/1387224206786498560?s=20)
requesting help with the debug of thread rendering performance. Among the people
heeding her call was the author of
[runyourown.social](http://runyourown.social/), a big inspiration for BobaBoard
itself. Only problem: the !kinkmeme thread causing the issue featured "extremely
hardcore" pornography.

introduced the first pair of anons, after they agreed to have their identities
