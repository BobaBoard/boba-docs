# Development Status

The first BobaBoard Realm was _quickly_ prototyped by Ms. Boba as a proof of
concept. Because of this, a lot of BobaBoard's features and design elements are
still rough around the edges. We're currently working to build a core team,
including volunteers, to bring the project to the next level. We're also in the
process of straightening up our bug tracking and clarifing our roadmap.

When in doubt, please err on the side of reporting clearly non-functional items,
obvious error messages, or things that just don't "seem right".

At the present moment, we're particularly interested in:

- anything that makes you go "aaargh" at least 3x per visit
- when you feel dumb because you can't understand something
- when you wish a feature was more like one on [*that other website that does it
  better*]
- when you give up trying to do something or find something
- things that you enjoy, feel intuitive, or overall good impressions

While we appreciate all reports, here's some stuff that we're currently putting
on the back burner:

- Issues with performance or JavaScript bundle size
- Visual improvements (unless particularly _rage_-inducing)
- Must-haves for a polished, production website that current users can still
  work around (e.g. unreadable, too-deeply nested comments, inability to delete
  posts)

Please remember that BobaBoard is still in its inception. While we foresee our
broad concepts (e.g. Realms, boards, contributions/comments, tags, roles) to be
here for the long run, we're open to thoughtful suggestions and opinions.

## Feedback

As mentioned above, we like to hear what's working with BobaBoard and what
isn't. Below are the easiest ways for you to submit feedback.

We do ask, no matter what method you use to submit feedback or whether your
feedback is positive or negative, that you keep in mind real volunteers who you
are probably sharing BobaBoard with are working hard to develop the site. Please
try to open issues, report bugs, and make feature suggestions and requests
respectfully, no matter how frustrating a situation might be.

You can provide feedback by:

- posting in the **!bobaland** Board for your Realm
- opening a [Github Issue](https://github.com/BobaBoard/issues/issues)
- becoming a [volunteer](/docs/volunteering)
