import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Fandom Coders is the first official Realm. It was launched on 4/20/2022 as an
experiment to ensure that it was possible for the BobaBoard code to support more
than one Realm on a domain.

<Aside type="note">

Fandom Coders is currently on hiatus while volunteers work to make realm set-up
and maintenance easier!
