<Aside type="caution">

The ability to self-host is still new and experimental. We'd love for people to
try it out and let us know how it goes, but we currently can't dedicate a lot of
engineering resources to helping you if you run into difficulties. Host at your
own risk!

</Aside>

## What is self-hosting, again?

Self-hosting means setting up your very own BobaBoard server for you to use as
you wish.

BobaBoard is easiest to configure on a server running NixOS. If you need help
with getting your server set up, head back to
[Configuring a NixOS Server](https://docs.bobaboard.com/docs/users/selfhosting/serversetup)

## Installing BobaBoard on a NixOS Server

{/* TODO: This page currently contains notes from the live self-hosting demo. It needs to be expanded and reviewed. */}

You can install Bobaboard on the server the same way you installed other
programs. (See example)

Also see example for how to enable and configure the Bobaboard service.

- configure the db
- configure the address
- configure firebase credentials
- configure SSL (certificate and key)

Reload the config. It's a simpler command now since the files are available on
the remote machine:

```
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#boba-example |& nix run nixpkgs#nix-output-monitor
```

Doing this without all the files in place will fail - so things like the
certificates, the firebase creds, etc. There will also be other errors! Read the
output!

One thing that needs troubleshooting is a missing directory needed for the boba
service to run correctly - it needs a `/var/lib/bobaboard` directory owned by
the `bobaboard` user that the service creates.

(Note that roughly around the 2hr mark is a whole bunch of troubleshooting for
this stuff)

Someone hosting their own Bobaboard instance will have to have a Firebase
accountâ€”they may or may not have to do much config. They'll likely need
authentication and storage enabled, and that might be enough. This is something
we'd need to test out.

Anyway, once you have the key/the SDK config, you'll want to save it at the
specified file path from the boba service config.

You can check `curl http://127.0.0.1:4200/realms/slug/uwu` to see if it's
working after the database gets seeded.

## Give it an address

DNS, SSL, Certificates

- Go to DNS provider and point the DNS to the server's IP
- Ask The Big Certificate Authority in the Sky for a certificate to enable
