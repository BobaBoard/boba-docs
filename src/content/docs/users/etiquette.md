As mentioned in other parts of the Guide, our two current Realms have more in
common than not in common. Below you'll find the guidelines for the type of
culture we're looking to cultivate in these Realms and their common rules.

:::info

Please keep in mind that as more Realms open, each Realm will have the
opportunity to define its own rules and code of conduct. The below guidelines
only apply to v0 and Fandom Coders Realms.

:::

## Our Values

- **Respect.**

  - Be mindful and courteous to fellow users.
  - Value de-escalation of conflict.
  - Respect identities, interests, boundaries, and kinks without making public
    judgment.
  - Act honestly and in good faith.
  - Don't insult people or call them by terms they would likely reject.
  - Respect people's pronouns if they choose to give them.
  - Do not engage in online harassment or doxxing.

- **Hate speech will not be tolerated.**

  In general, this can be summarized as, “no racism, sexism, ableism, etc.” More
  specifically, we ask that users respect the following:

  - Intersectionality is important.
  - Be mindful about appropriating or misusing symbols and imagery that are
    important to other communities.
  - Don't debate people's lived experiences, even if you disagree with their
    conclusions.
  - Racism is a real, systematic, and ongoing issue.
  - Ableism is real and has profound impact on those it affects.
  - Don’t fat-shame.
  - Respect everyone’s right to sexual freedom.
  - Sex work is work.
  - People have the full right to self-identify as the gender they choose.
  - Don't debate who belongs or doesn't belong in the LGBT+ community.

- **Be supportive.**

  This does not mean that you must agree with everyone on every issue or that
  someone's feelings can't be hurt during a misunderstanding. It does mean that
  you should not go out of your way to tear down another user or seek to
  intentionally cause harm.

- **Respect people's squicks/triggers.**

  Please add content notices to posts when asked. Please also do not get upset
  if moderators add content notices to your posts for you.

  For more information on content notices and tagging, please see
  [Tagging](/docs/users/howto/tagging).

## Posting Guidelines

- **There is no such thing as necroposting!** Feel free to comment on threads no
  matter their age. You're not bothering anyone with notifications or by giving
  them someone to talk to.

- **Respect the Original Posters's (OP's) wishes.** In threads, _OP has the
  final say on what is allowed on their thread_. Making a different thread to
  discuss something OP would rather not touch upon is allowed, but avoid
  "subtle" jabs at the previous OP (trust us, they're never subtle). In other
  words, please be thoughtful and cautious when 'vagueblogging' or 'subtweeting'
  about in Realm posts.

- **Please do not continue pressing an issue after someone has asked you to
  stop.** This aligns with our respect value. It's simply not a good way to
  de-escalate conflict and is not courteous. _Reminder:_ please also be
  respectful when requesting someone drop a conversation or leave a thread.

- **If you need help interpreting the tone of a message, responding to a
  difficult message, or de-escalating a situation, please feel free to reach out
  to Ms. Boba, a Discord moderator, or complete the anonymous form for your
  Realm.** We are always willing to help you if you're uncomfortable or just
  aren't sure how to proceed.
