<Aside type="note">

The v0 Realm is part of the boba.social Galaxy which is privately run by ms.
boba. For more information, see [Galaxy & Realm Admins](../admins).

The v0 Realm is currently not adding more members.

</Aside>

The v0 Realm is the Alpha version of BobaBoard, the place where the magic
started and the flagship of the BobaBoard concept. It's a little wacky and a
little off the beaten path. If you're interested in seeing what BobaBoard is all
about, check out the below information to see if V0 might be a good fit.

## How to Sign-Up

### Would you like it?

<Aside type="caution">

The v0 realm is open for NSFW materials to be posted everywhere; it is not
constrained to a single board. Please use caution when viewing boards and be
sure to read
[content notices and other indicators](/users/howto/tagging#cn) carefully.
Although members often use content notices and spoilers as a courtesy, **this is
voluntary** and their use is not required or enforced/moderated.

</Aside>

V0 users are one-part volunteer, one-part extremely patient alpha testers, and
one-part "anything goes" users.

The people who fit in best in V0 are those who are okay dealing with the quirks
of a site still under active development and who are willing to **not only** put
up with bugs, weird behaviors, and occasional site breakages, but who are also
**not afraid to report it**.

In general, V0 users need to be okay with managing their own risk - i.e. muting
threads or boards that contain things they don't want to see, actively avoid
[content notices](/users/howto/tagging#cn) that might trigger or squick
them, and who are willing to handle not being able to filter or block certain
tags or content. Quality of life features like filtering and blocking are on the
way, but have taken a backseat to things like moderation tools for Realms.

V0 users should also be able to follow the
[General BobaBoard Etiquette](/users/etiquette) without needing intense
moderator oversight. That doesn't mean that moderation **never** happens, but it
does mean that users need to be self-aware enough to make sure they aren't
crossing lines and escalating situations without meaning to.

There is a strong presence of fan creators and fandom community leaders,
furries, and people who are into "problematic content" often not welcome in
other communities (i.e. vore, gore, lolisho, torture, incest, etc). Although
it's not a requirement that you consume or produce content with these themes,
you do have to be okay with interacting and (anonymously) being friends with
people who consume that content.

If this all sounds like a good fit, feel free to ask for an invite.

### How to Get an Invite

Please email the realm admin listed for V0 on the
[Realm Admins](/users/admins) page. Please be sure to include the Realm
name (VO) and an email you want to have the invite sent to (particularly if it's
different than the one you're emailing from!).
