## Boards

As mentioned in [BobaBoard Basics: Boards](/docs/users/intro#boards), Realms are
made up of boards that define the broad topics of conversation within the Realm.
The sidebar of each Board contains the Board cover image, name, description,
categories, and additional relevant information (if any). On desktop, the
sidebar is to the left of the screen. On mobile, you can find the Board's
sidebar by clicking the navigation symbol in the bottom bar.

Boards update chronologically, moving the most recent activity to the top for
easy identification.

There are two ways to access boards:

- from the landing page, click on the board cover
- click the board link in the sidebar menu

To access the sidebar menu, click the hamburger (three horizonal line) menu on
the left side of the screen.

### The Board Menu

Once you've clicked into a Board, you can find a menu with options for the
board, by clicking the triangle in the top right corner of the cover image. This
allows you to control the settings for the individual board. Within that menu
you can:

- **Mute/Unmute** - toggle notifications for the Board.
  - Muted boards will not show up on the **Recent Unreads** section of the menu.
  - Muting a board does not clear notifications. When you unmute, the
    notifications will still be present.
  - Muted boards also do not show up in your [Personal Feed](#personal-feed).
- **Pin/Unpin** - toggle whether the Boards appears in your pinned bar (to the
  far left of the side bar). You can pin boards so that you make sure you don't
  miss recent activity between visits or to make them easier to access.
- **Dismiss Notifications** - Clear notifications of unread items without having
  to visit them all.

### Notifications

Notifications alert you to updated content in a Board, whether that's a new
thread or a comment/contribution to a thread. There are two places you can see
notifications and multiple colors of notifications.

- **Sidebar Menu** - the hamburger menu (three horizontal line) receives a
  notification bubble when there's new activity on any unmuted board. There are
  two colors of notification dots which can appear:

  - **Red** - there is a new update on a Board since the last time you visited
    it.
  - **White** - there are unread updates on Boards but they are older than your
    last visit.

- **Boards Notification** - appear on the corner of cover images for Boards on
  the landing page and in the sidebar menu. There are two colors of notification
  dots which can appear:
  - **Bright** - there is a new update on this board since the last time you
    visited.
  - **Darker** - there are unread updates, but they're older than your last
    visit.

## Feeds

Feeds allow you to track and follow conversations that you've started or joined
without having to go to a specific board. They're similar to a timeline view
which you may be familiar with on other websites. Feeds update chronologically,
so that the post with the newest activity is moved to the top.

### Personal Feed

The Personal Feed shows you all threads you've posted, joined, or commented on
in the Realm you're in. To access your personal feed, click the inbox tray icon
in the pinned bar. To filter your feed, you can click the buttons on the left
sidebar to see specific threads. An explanation for the filter combinations is
below.

- **updated** **own** - all threads you've started in the Realm that have been
  updated with a new comment or contribution.
- **updated** **everyone** - all threads you've started or joined with a comment
  or contribution in the Realm that have been updated with a new comment or
  contribution.
- **all** **own** - every thread you've ever started in the Realm
- **all** **everyone** - every thread you've started or joined with a comment or
  contribution in the Realm
