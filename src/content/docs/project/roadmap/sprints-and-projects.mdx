## Sprints

We're currently scheduling (~6-weeks long) thematic sprints, during which
volunteers get together to work on a series of related bugs and features.
Sprints are most often meant to advance [overarching projects](#projects), and
may share issues with them.

If you're interested in officially joining a current or future sprint, contact
Ms Boba.

## Projects

Projects capture overarching goals of BobaBoard, and track both completed and
missing items currently on their roadmap. Not all BobaBoard's features and
issues are captured in a project, and projects might be worked on during
[one or more sprints](#sprints) (or outside them as we see fit).
