Each `Realm` that supports `Anonymity` must have an associated `BobaDex`,
containing all the anonymous identities that can be assigned to `users` when
they create new `threads`.

A `BobaDex` can be further divided in `Seasons`, each containing a subset of the
`Identities` in the `BobaDex`.

:::OPEN QUESTION

- Can `boards` or `threads` have their own BobaDex?
- Can `users` choose which `Season` to post from when joining a `thread`?
