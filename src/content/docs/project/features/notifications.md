This page acts as documentation for the features (and logic) associated with
BobaBoard notifications.

## Muting Boards

Muting a board hides its notification dot from the BobaBoard sidebar. It doesn't
by default dismiss the notifications inside each thread posted in the board.
This is so people who want to avoid being notified for board activity but want
to periodically check on the board on their own can still take advantage of
notifications to see updates to specific threads.
